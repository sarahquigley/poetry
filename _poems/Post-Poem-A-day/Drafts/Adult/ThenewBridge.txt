The New Bridge

A creature straight from the pages
of the War of the Worlds,
it has dug its claws into the soil
of old Dundrum
and hunkered down on its haunches-
St. George's bells peel its arrival,
and spider on spider on spider,
little feet disturb the hairs
on the back of my hand,
and ivy sinks first roots
into concrete.



oh the webs/bridges new lovers weave/build for each other
and how they decorate them
its rigging stretches to the sky
and the wind plays its cables like a harp
"it is like a beached ship" you whispered
"before it landed here
on our small planet
a great sail of purest whitest energy
stretched from that thin curved mast"
I replied

those pillars hide the shaft of a glass elevator
and deep in the caverns they have hollowed
beneath the streets of Dundrum
small fat eyed men/aliens with silver suits
and laser guns and robots to make blood tea
and harvest our organs
watch us as we make love on the tracks
of Dundrum Luas bridge
the stars pulsing above us
and cars pulsing below
and Mars hovering unblinking
an ever-watchful eye



The New Bridge

A machine torn straight from the pages
of <i>the War of the Worlds</i>,
it has dug claws into the soil of old Dundrum
and hunkered down on its haunches.

st. George's Bells peel its arrival.
Spider on spider on spider,
little feet disturb hairs
on the back of my hands,
and ivy sinks first roots
into concrete - the webs we weave,

oh the bridges new lovers build for each other,
rigging stretches to the sky
and wind plays the cables like a harp.
It is like a beached ship, you whispered.
Before it landed here on our small planet
a sail of purest whitest energy
stretched from that thin curved mast,
I replied.

Those pillars hide the shaft of a glass elevator
and, deep in the caverns they have hollowed
beneath the streets of Dundrum,
small fat eyed men with silver suits and laser guns
watch us as we make love on the tracks
of Dundrum Luas bridge-
stars pulsing above us,
cars pulsing below
and Mars hovering, unblinking,
an ever-watchful eye.
