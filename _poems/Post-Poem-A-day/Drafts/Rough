We have grown tree-like
in branches firm and taut
I am support

did you feel the soil between yours toes
last year
it's the same soil now
cool and moist and good smelling
the same as the year before
when we dug for worms
and the same as the year before that one
when nothing remarkable happened at all

and it smells good and feels good
but there is something stale in the air
that loses me and makes want to turn

we are drinking beer and growing older
slowly by the year until we have hardened tree-like
from saplings into bent beasts/animals 
drinking fucking scheming dreaming beasts

Men march forward, march onwards forwards move
we are a caterpillar you are the feet and the head swoons
when she sees the sunlight

Oh high mountain, catch me soon...
I am all legs, as I tumble

I marched through the woods
the smell of moss and peat slipped

at night I dream of a woman
