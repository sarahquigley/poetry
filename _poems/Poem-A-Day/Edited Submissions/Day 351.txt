Day 351

Poem 1

Somewhere beneath the chipboard
a rat has bloated and birthed
flies to tsk about our kitchen-

at night we herd them to the light,
close doors, open windows-
the world is cold and we
are cruel parents.


Poem 2

He taught me 
how to creep in silence
through the brittle bush
and how to pick out bins
with the juiciest fruit-

Brother,
fast furdeep bloodsleek
serpentine,
Brother-

your muzzle collapses 
freeing the porcelain of teeth
and bones
to whiten in the winter sun-

while the fur on my lips
speckles and fades.
