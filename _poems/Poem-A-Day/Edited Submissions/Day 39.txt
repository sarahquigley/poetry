Rain songs

I

I've broken the umbrella,
The trees are turning yellow
and every corner of the sky
is grey,

Walk with me,

We'll get soaked together,
I've broken the umbrella
but I know it'll all turn out
okay.


II

The clouds in the sky are
singing,

We're floating, oh we're floating,
floating on an ocean of blue
air,

We're dancing, oh we're dancing,
dancing like petals on the
wind,

We're growing, oh we're growing,
growing and you know it,
black and ominous we loom,

We're bursting, 
we hope the ground is thirsting
for some rain.


III

splish splash rumble sploosh
rain oh rain delicious rain 
and thunder

the worms are out
they gad about
rain oh rain delicious rain
