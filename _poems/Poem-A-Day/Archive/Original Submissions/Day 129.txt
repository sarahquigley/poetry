Day 129



	Day 129 by *a-random-quigle



Oh I&#146;m leaving did I tell you Joanna,
I&#146;m off to wander the haygrass
bogbrush dewrush wilds of no town-
oh and I&#146;m selling my frown
and my pinafore to a second-hand store
and I&#146;m never wearing them again,
not even on Sundays-
and Joanna you can use my mp3 player to prop up
the leg on the kitchen table.

Did I tell you Joanna that I&#146;ve been too long
on this big boat, it&#146;s so calm it hurts
and the captain tells me
there&#146;s no chance of landing anytime soon-
oh I&#146;m taking my chances alone on the sea,
I&#146;ll inflate like a whale
a small float waves at my throat
and birds will wave from the shore
on the wing-
and I&#146;ll greet them as I beach myself,
bob hoppin&#146; birds that skirt and pert
my seed fingers-
and they&#146;ll teach me to sing again
and I&#146;ll teach them to weave nests,
mobiles - all moons and spiders.

Or perhaps perhaps Joanna,
and I consider it a real possibility,
the moon will fall on me as I float
alone on the darkening rocking sea
and I&#146;ll die a silver death,
alone and landless.

And oh Joanna I&#146;ll miss you, 
did I tell you that?
