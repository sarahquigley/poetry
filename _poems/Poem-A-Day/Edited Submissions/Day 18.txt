Rhyme for the wind / Rhyme for the stars


I

Oh the breeze is a shimmery dragonfly
and the wind is a mean old dog-
the wind is a mean old dog
howling for his walk.



She waited in the playground for-
what does it matter

she waited

and played on the slides
and swung so high

and remembered:



Oh the breeze is a shimmery dragonfly
and the wind is a mean old dog-
the wind is a mean old dog
howling for his walk.


II

Shake a baker’s apron out on the twilight,
there will be crumbs of Madeira cake and shortbread
it’s certain
and they will glow on the lips of the breeze 



Finally
stars floated on the water

she swam naked

fafloosh!

her hair was a moon on the sea

and she remembered:



Shake a baker’s apron out on the twilight,
there will be crumbs of Madeira cake and shortbread
it’s certain
and they will glow on the lips of the breeze wahey
they will glow on the lips of the breeze
