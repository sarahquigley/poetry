Poem 1

February 17th

Whale Concert
Maze, Fin, Goose, Droplet
Singing in the Echo Mountains
There will never be another one like it



Poem 2

is Silver the only one awake
in the warren?

a starless night
owls prowl and foxes
wow-o-wow-o-wow
across the fields

her sisters dream
of spring
fields fresh with
grass and clover

Silver thinks of snow



Poem 3

Every morning
a man tosses a coin in the fountain-
he wishes his wife would stop nagging him
about the fig tree his father planted
and for his son to fall in love with rich women.
Plop!

Every afternoon
a small girl tosses a coin in the fountain.
Plop!
She likes that noise.
