Day 102



	Day 102 by *a-random-quigle



If I were a fox
snuffling on the lawn
on some summer evening
the trees would still be huge,
the birds small -

the ladybirds would still be soldiers
in bright red coats.

You said I was a flower
petals wilting, falling out,
stalk yellowing,
but the differences
I&#146;m not gonna go like that
I&#146;m gonna bloom again.

Chicken farmer

I will eat a three pieces of chicken for dinner
and then I will sleep,
I will not dream of chicken
I hope.

The harvest failed
so we went to the 
supermarket.

The temporary fox

On Saturday nights he adjusts his ears,
pins his tail on,
he bought them on ebay
from a fox in Limavady,
second hand you know
but still in mint condition
and so, bright and bushy tailed,
he swaggers about town -

the rest of the week
he is a badger.
