Day 300


Pulling branches down,
Bear whispers to the ground,
"There was honey here,
but it has disappeared,
oh tut."

Flicking at the water,
he wades a little deeper,
"Though I'm getting wetter,
the fishing isn't better,
oh tut."

Digging in the thorns,
Bear turns with a yawn
and huffs "Oh tut,
it's time for bed -
wake me when the berries

turn red."
