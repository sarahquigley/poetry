Shel Silverstein is dead

Today a piece of my childhood was killed

I never knew Shel Silverstein died
in 1999

in my edition
of where the sidewalk ends
he is alive and well
and stares from the backleaf
with his weird beard and big eyes

from the backleaf of my edition
of where the sidewalks ends
he stares
weir eyed bearded
