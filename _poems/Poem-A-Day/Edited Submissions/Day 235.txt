The Potter&#039;s Hands

The potter&#039;s skin is porcelain, mountainous-
rivers run in the creases of his hands,
burst their banks, dash their colour on the land!

Blue huts on stepped hillsides, blue willows
rinsing their hair in slow blue streams,
little blue Chinamen in blue cone hats
wading through blue patties,
blue bridges and temples and birds,

the potter&#039;s hands are veined blue,
fraught with his own kind of tattoo.
