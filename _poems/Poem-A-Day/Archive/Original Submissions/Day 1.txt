Day 1

I

I crash through mountains
hop a castle
a tunnel caves beneath my toes

I dodge toddlers
and lovers
old women with dogs-

To the water
To the water
To the water

I go
where you graze like a deer
for seashells-

II

My son tosses salt in the water
"Snow is falling through the air,
snow is falling in your curly hair,"
he sings to the fusilli.


III

Their small noses are a heady sight
poking over the counter.

Launched from jar
to jar to jar
the glass is smooth.

Lollipops
gumdrops
jelly beans fudge.

Their wide eyes are a heady sight
peering over the counter.

IV

the train slips darkly through the undergrowth
wheels glisten in the night-

a breeze whistles darkly through the undergrowth
the moon is bright-

a fox slips darkly through the undergrowth
my last apple is bright-

the path can't be seen in the darkness
but home is bright
your lips are bright
late night bowls of cereal are bright
pizza is bright-
