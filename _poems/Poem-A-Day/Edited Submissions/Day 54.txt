Day 54

Poem 1

How about we slather ourselves in seriousness,
Grease ourselves up so that we shine with all the pomp 
And pretension of three small fat men in convertibles,

Then
Let’s slather this poem in seriousness,
Grease it up so that it shines with all the pomp
And pretension of three small fat men in convertibles

writing metapoetry.



Poem 2

And so a shower is way to wash my troubles down the drain?
And oh a shower is a way to purge my lovers from my skin?
And oh and so a shower is a way to wash the city and its spin
down oh down the drain?

Fuck purity. I’ll have sex all night long 
in the shower if that’s what it takes.
