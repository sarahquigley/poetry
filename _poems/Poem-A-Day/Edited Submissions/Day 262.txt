Day 262

Poem 1

Getting older has led me to become interested in new things
like hot water bottles and cups of tea,
and the size and make of other people&#039;s dishwashers.
I can&#039;t decide whether my new found interest in these things
means that I&#039;ve gained a deeper appreciation
for the small things in life
or that I&#039;m getting more boring, it&#039;s probably the latter.

Getting older has led me to reflect on the people that I have loved,
that have loved me, the people that I regret...
it terrifies me how easily those that were once so important
get tossed away - like orange rind or old shoes,
what a terible thing it must be to realise
that there are fewer people ahead of you
than you have left behind.



Poem 2

When you&#039;re five years old, what&#039;s there to regret?
You might have drawn on the kitchen walls,
had couple of falls, grazed a few knees,
but nothing&#039;s really mattered yet.

When you&#039;re sixteen, you&#039;ve probably seen a few things,
had your first proper kiss and wished it had gone better,
said some really stupid things, lost a friend or two perhaps-
but you&#039;re just becoming aware of all the endless possibilities,
so who the fuck really cares?

When you&#039;re twenty five, you might just be twice shy,
but you&#039;re still raring to go- the night is still enticing,
romance is still entrancing,
you&#039;re still cool, you know.

When you&#039;re forty four, life&#039;s a bit of a snore,
but that&#039;s okay- your kids are growing up,
your body&#039;s still working, well enough,
there&#039;s still time to get back in touch with your wild side.

When you&#039;re sixty seven, you must look back at your life
and say, hot-danged, where did it go?
Where are all the people that I used to know?
And when you shake your head, regret must pour from your ears
like you&#039;re some giant regret shaker- things don&#039;t taste quite so fine
when you&#039;ve spiced them like that.

And when you&#039;re ninety nine, well everything must suck.
