Day 345



	Day 345 by *a-random-quigle


Tell me how the sun feels,
dying everyday,
plunging into oceans
melting over cities
hot rain.

A grey dove sleeps
on the iron girders
of Pearse Street station,
plankton are sifted
by a baleen whale,
I comb lice from my hair.

No death on the dusty moon-
or life- I'll build a dome
in the dandelion crater
and keep robots,
the last alive alone.
