Day 276



	Day 276 by *a-random-quigle



The woman watches for the postman,
she didn&#039;t hear him yesterday
so he slipped a note under the door-

Mrs. McCauley please collect your parcel
from Sandyford post depot
as soon as possible,

leaves slip over leaves-
a breeze lifts the sun
right up

and scatters today&#039;s paper
all across the lawn.
