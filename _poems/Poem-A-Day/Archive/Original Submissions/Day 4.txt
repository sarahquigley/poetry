Day 4

Fruit Tree

When I was five years old
I found him floating on the water,
a small surprise-

Bury him in the yard
where the daffodils grow
my mother said,
plant him like a seed

In spring a tree will grow
In summer petals will fall
like sun-burnt snow
By autumn every branch
will sag
heavy
with goldfish,

we’ll gather them in bowls-
