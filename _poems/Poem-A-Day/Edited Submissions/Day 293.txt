Day 293



	Day 293 by *a-random-quigle



The houses of the York Road
spill very gently on to the footpath,
old houses, tall thin red brick.
Old money and thus, by extension,
filled with the old, mainly fine women
whose husbands having died
sit in their gardens during the summer
watching the flowers wilt
in the heat.
