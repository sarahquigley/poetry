Poem 1

Thursday

The little man I cut from yesterday&#039;s newspaper
is lost,
and he&#039;s got a family,
little paper kids cut Tuesday&#039;s newspaper, a paper wife
from Monday&#039;s-
they live in my desk drawer
between the stapler and the sellotape.

Today I cut a paper dog.



Poem 2

hands poised
to shake out those 
straggling words
those ones that slip into
the cracks in the keyboard
that make the keys stick
