Day 340



	Day 340 by *a-random-quigle

I am built of book knowledge,
muddled scratchings of too many men-
for all the books that I have read,
what have I learned?

Meerkats are immune
to scorpion sting
that Maori women are best won
with eels

while you sift the subtleties
of dreamland
mothers reorder your head
that I do not understand
wave particle duality

that the solar system alone
is bigger than I can conceive
to serve chocolate with chicken
and mango with fish

that on Shouting Hill
the women chaff their legs
to catch their monthly blood.

How would I be
if that was all I knew
rough leaves wind
rough men?
