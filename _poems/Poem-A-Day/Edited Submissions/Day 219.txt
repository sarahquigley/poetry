Day 219

Poem 1

Darlin&#039;, the heat starts me dripping,
I can&#039;t handle those sunburst breasts-
let&#039;s keep the curtains closed.
Darlin&#039;, let&#039;s keep the curtains closed,
though it&#039;s night-
moon brings blood,
moonlight will open you like a fan,
and my tongue will get the better of me.


Poem 2

Every city needs a corner drunk
to shout abuses at passers-by
through landless gums,
a corner drunk, but only one.
We can glance over shoulders and declare
"Now isn&#039;t it quaint,
now isn&#039;t it nice - there&#039;s still
some proper characters about!"

It simple enough-
every city needs one corner drunk, 
one wise bum and one bag lady...
requirements and quota-
anymore and people start 
to feel jittery.

Where does that leave you,
you crooked thing? 
The corner drunk sits by Mahaffy&#039;s,
the bag lady rifle bins on the Mespil Road,
the wise bum seems to just turn up
when and where we need him.
Sorry Sir, positions filled,
get out of here! 

Where does that leave you,
you crooked thing? All you&#039;ve got
is some peculiar angles,
like some shoddy workman
made you with a pair of pliers-
out of a bicycle wheel, chicken wire.

Poem 3

Calling me gently,
the wind opens two doors-
one is in my head,
a lonesome door that creaks a little.
I&#039;m not sure where the other door is,
there&#039;s a lack of logic to it,
the fuzziness of static-
a station not quite in tune.
I could spend hours peering
through that door
trying to make things out
of that strange half zebra soup.
Today a silver insect buzzes
from the fuzz, 
it flies a little... not skyward,
but to the ground to meet me.


Poem 4

What an artist I am!
The soup has boiled dry
and the pot has got that nice neat ring
of delicious black right around the bottom-
and this time it&#039;s not Simon&#039;s fault
or yours Mark.


Poem 5

anonymously flashy car
a song throttles down the street


Poem 6

New York, an autumn day,
September 26th, 2002,
there may have been a funeral
(there were probably a few)
but seeing is believing, so they say,
and I never saw a thing.
Dublin was a little far away
(there is no bus)
and I was busy with my thises
and my thats.
Now I&#039;ve been asked to fly
to New York
for some commemoration,
to stand uncomfortably by the grave
sobbing, or whatever it is you do
at that kind of thing-
but the thought of staying
in some dingy old hotel room,
and not with you,
irks me a little.
Money isn&#039;t made by bees,
and even if it is,
I&#039;m no beekeeper.


Poem 7

I found some thoughts on the ground
between a cigarette butt
and one of those lids for your portable coffee-
so I said fuck it, and I put them in my pocket.
I&#039;m not certain whose thoughts they were,
or if they want them back at all,
but I&#039;ll tell you one thing-
I didn&#039;t hand them in to the Gardai.


Poem 8

You&#039;re too damned good for me,
you are gentle amber
and I&#039;m just some impish jerk-
but give me a chance love,
and I&#039;ll show you how it works...
I&#039;ll swoop down like a hawk,
I&#039;ll sweep you off your feet,
I&#039;ll take you out for dinner-
wine you and dine you
just like any other jerk...
You want a love song-
I&#039;ll sing as vibrant a jingle
as any drunk would come up with
in that high pressure situation
You want comedy-
will some slapstick do?
I&#039;ll swoop down like a hawk,
I&#039;ll sweep you off your feet,
I&#039;ll dump you in a bed,
and we&#039;ll see what happens next.
