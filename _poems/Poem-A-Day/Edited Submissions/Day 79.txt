Day 79



	Day 79 by *a-random-quigle



The man is bald
he is tartan
itchy

but his voice
shivers
huskily

you want him.

---

Two girls wobble
down the canalwalk
on just one bicycle.

They pause beneath
a bridge
and kiss.

---

We complain about
the same old stew
it nettles you to break
habit.

---

I am drunk

I am a phonebox,
smashed, sleeping with
some homeless guy.

---

No man can ride me

I am a lesbian,
I am a wild horse.
