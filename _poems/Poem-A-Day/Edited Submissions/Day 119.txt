Day 119



	Day 119 by *a-random-quigle



I plait your hair -
it&#146;s brittle and thin on the top,
if you were a doll
I&#146;d send you to the doll hospital
where they&#146;d fill your wrinkles with porcelain
and retouch your cheeks
rosy, they&#146;d fit you a new wig
and stitch it to your scalp.
