Day 22

I

Toy soldiers

A clockwork bird alights
on a toothpick mast
and sings a small song,

sings a little song
as the melon boat rises and sinks in the half-light,
carrying men to far-off lands,

far-away lands
of cold mattresses
and Lego bandits.



III

Small song

God bless the supple fingers
that sewed the first red dress,
you may not think it right lord
but I’ve something to confess:

I can think of nothing finer
than a morsel of a girl
slinking on the town
giving her hips a twirl,

her lips popping like cherries
her waist oh so divine
her nipples pouting pertly
her skin porcelain fine,

and oh lord when you touch her
she gives to you like clay,
an ever yielding sculpture
for you to mould all day
and all night
and all day
‘til-

God bless the supple fingers 
that sewed the first red dress,
God bless the supple fingers
that shaped those god-damned breasts.



III

Desert sky

two small suns press
through the curves
of a cornflower dress
