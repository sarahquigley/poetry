Day 339



	Day 339 by *a-random-quigle


The tusk of the narwhal
is spun from currents,
the pulsing of jellyfish,
the underside of dreams
and old tales-

Blubber
and long songs
bob with the waves
away from slick shifting
ships

and old kings
hobble to gilded thrones-
and kings may boast
about their canes-
a unicorn horn.
