Poem 1

Fruit salad

Wait down in the field my love
I won’t be long I swear,
I’ll build a little house there
And love will grow from the trees I plant around us.

---

Your girl presses her nose
to the window,
there it is the melon-striped
dress
she hankers after.

Oh she’d be a fruit
too juicy to eat
in that creation,
she’d get all over you
and you could never go home to your 

wife.

---

Wait down in the field my love
I won’t be long I swear,
I’ll build a little house there
And love will grow from the trees I plant around us,
In summer we’ll live on sunlight,
In winter we’ll live on snow.

I’ll have you in the garden,
I’ll have you on the stairs,
I’ll have you in the kitchen,
I’ll have you everywhere,
Love will blow from the flowers I plant around us.



Poem 2

Pavement artist

Chalk is soft between his fingers,
Concrete hard beneath his feet,
Rain hard against his cheeks
As he gathers his things
And races to take shelter.
 
His hours soften into puddles,
A rainbow trickles down the street.
