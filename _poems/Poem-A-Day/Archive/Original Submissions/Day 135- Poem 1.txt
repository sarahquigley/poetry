Day 135- Poem 1



	Day 135- Poem 1 by ~a-random-quigle



There&#146;s a piece of yourself
that is precious and rare,
a jewel that you keep
in a box that you lock,
a box that you keep
in a drawer that you lock-

don&#146;t be a fool
I spit and sputter and drool,
you&#146;re not a kitchen
you don&#146;t have presses,
be a woman
be a woman (for me).

This place is a landfull
of beasts and bears,
of serpents with golden tongues
and yellowing teeth,
a dirty old horse
a dirty old horse-

and if you&#146;re just a girl
in a landfill of beasts,
lips breast womb,
places of safety
become places of fear,
lion bear wolf
lion bear wolf
lion bear wolf.
