Day 137

My love, let me tell you a secret,
some people are better than you-
they tidy the kitchen without being asked,
and go to the gym three times a week,
they’re experts in ancient Greek
language mythology-
Sinope Pasiphae Carme Ananke,

they always put down the toilet seat,
they’ve read all of Dickens 
and Browning and Yeats
and can integrate equations 
of two or more variables as they sleep,
they buy white lilies every Tuesday-
Elara Lysithea Himalia Leda.

Some people are better than you-
they tidy the kitchen without being asked,
they know big words like 'dirigible'
and use them in prose
and on shopping lists,
one dirigible pear please-
Callisto Ganymede Europa Io,

they cook sushi and know
more than three sexual positions,
loyalty of a dog passion of a panther,
they whisper the names
of the moons of Jupiter 
slowly, syncopatively
as their lover climaxes-
Thebe Almathea Adrastea Metis.

They draw picture perfect nudes
in charcoal and pastels,
I prefer stick figures.
