Day 203

Poem 1

As a girl, dolls were tidied into a wicker box:
wicker, because dolls, like you or I, must breathe.
A little later, fruit filled out the box-
apples, plums, starfruit,
new toys,
colours poking through the wicker work.
Later, uncertainties developed about what to use that box for-
photos, to stowaway pantyhose perhaps.


Poem 2- a haiku

Old gold leaf-
chipping paint disturbs
the crisp air
