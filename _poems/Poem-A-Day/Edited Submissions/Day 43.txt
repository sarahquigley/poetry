Day 43



	Day 43 by *a-random-quigle



At first it seems the tulips
are singing-
and then you spot her, small bright
bird in the grass
kneeling and singing and weeding.

She pecks among the marigolds
stirring a song of soup, weeds for vegetables, 
a trowel spoon, bucket for a pot,
the day is long and bright and hot
and she sings and and sweats and weeds,
until the sun is stuttering on the horizon.
and the garden is neat and bright and clean
as your Sunday best.
