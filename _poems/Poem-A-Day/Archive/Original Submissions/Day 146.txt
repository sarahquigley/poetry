Poem 1

Pebbles

New tarmacadam
becomes familiar with feet,
pebbles materialise with every beat.
Embedded in street,
a constellation of treasures
for magpies to covet
but fail to collect.



Poem 2

Letters from Edinburgh

Leaflets, maps, picturesque postcards
are still spilling from my notebooks,
wallet, pockets of my bag-
I throw them all away
only to find they&#039;ve reappeared
in my back pocket
or unfolded languorously on my bed.
I expect to find them in my shoes
and under my pillow,
sprayed with perfume.
Persistent buggers,
love letters.



Poem 3

Another day in the park

Hisshum of buses letting off steam,
scraw of gulls, whoosh of breeze,
creak of something like a wheel,
a singer perhaps.
Yummy! For supper?
I&#039;m not coming home
right this very minute
but I&#039;ll be home soon.
Distant river,
horses letting off steam,
guy mangling a guitar,
whoosh of breeze.

Kid running down the hill,
pink leggings,
light reflecting off beads,
whoosh of breeze.
Blades of grass,
silver shivers in the sun,
insects crawling,
their steps invisible, unfelt,
as they move from earth to skin
and back again.
Hair splashing, knotting, 
tugging at faces,
trees smothering faces,
whoosh of breeze.
