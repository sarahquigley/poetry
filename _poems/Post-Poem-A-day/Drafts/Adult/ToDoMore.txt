to see more
and to touch more
and to feel more
and to be more
and to get more
you must give more
to try more
you must taste more
but to taste more
you must try more
and its vicious
and its awkward
its sublime
because to get more
you must give more
and to give more
you must feel more
but to feel more
you must live more
and to live more
to live more
you let loose more
you let other people in more
you slip more
and you fall more
but its good
you run free more
and you dance more
and you sing more
and you forget more
forget how it feels
to forget
