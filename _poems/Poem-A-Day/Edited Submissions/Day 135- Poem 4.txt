Day 135- Poem 4



	Day 135- Poem 4 by *a-random-quigle



I was never much into the feminine world,
I wore baggy t-shirts and jeans
and played with the boys in the yard-
all push and shove and mudrough games,
I looked in disdain at the girls
with their quiet passtimes
and clean fingers.

I grew older and my figure rounded out
in some of the right places,
I picked out some nice clothes
and I kissed some nice boys
and I softened a little,
but only a little.

But I&#146;ve been seduced by your feminine world
and there&#146;s so much more
than makeup and kitchen appliances,
trips to the hairdresser,
it&#146;s only now loving a woman...

But I&#146;ve been seduced by your womanly ways
of skirts and beads and yellowing lace,
of silk caravels and shivering seas,
of wild horses,
of minnows and willows
and reeds,
it&#146;s only now loving a woman...
