Day 327



	Day 327 by *a-random-quigle



I want to choose the way
to fade-
the bits the sunlight eats away
the sun and all the wriggling rays
the sea and all the gnawing waves
the shape of shells
the way the final sculpture falls-
I want to choose it all.

At the end of the day,
I think dinner and I wonder
where leftovers went - I rifle the freezer.
Will there be food for dinner tomorrow?
And after that?
Soup days and sauce days
microwaveable pie days
splodged gently on one another.
