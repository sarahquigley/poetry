Day 256



	Day 256 by *a-random-quigle



Beyond the window,
that same bird swoops
for the seed
I left out on the stoop.

A little thing,
a twitcher hopper pecker
to use the scientific name,
my woman moves like that-

I like to feed that bird-
she flies for freedom&#039;s sake,
but soon she&#039;s back
for second seeding.
