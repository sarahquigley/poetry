Day 362



	Day 362 by *a-random-quigle


Too easy to forget that this was
your childhood, not my own-
you that trundled home
spilling buckets of rock shrimp,
you that decorated this house with
waveworn flowers of coral,
you that placed that husk of a crab
on the windowsill
where it sits still, gathering dust.
