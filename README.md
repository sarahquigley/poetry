Poetry, and code.

View live version: [Read my poetry.](http://sarahquigley.github.io/poetry/)

## What is this project?

I enjoy writing poetry. This project creates a simple website where my poetry is displayed. It also acts as an online back-up for all my poetry work to date.

## Why did you make this?

I wanted a simple and elegant way to publicly display my poetry portfolio.

## Any features worth noting?

### Simple design

The ultra-simple look of the website was designed to keep the focus of the visitor on the poetry itself.

### Responsive design

The website's design is fully responsive. The site is just as beautiful (and easy to read) on mobile, tablet or desktop. 

## Did you create the design for the website?

Yes, the design is my own, with some inspiration taken from here and there around the web.

## What tools did you use to create this project? 

### Jekyll static site generator and hosting with Github Pages

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an excellent static site generator and the engine behind [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), makes it really simple to create a ready-to-publish static site. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provides simple and free hosting for Jekyll sites. These are my go-to tools for web-based personal projects.

### SASS and Bourbon SASS mixin library

I write all my CSS using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) is a handy library of SASS mixins and more that I recommend.

### Google WebFonts

[Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) is an excellent resource for creating beautiful online typography.

### Font Awesome Icons

[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is my go to icon font for use online.

### Modernizr

[Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) allows you to detect browser feature support, ensuring older browsers can be supported with greater ease.

### JQuery and JQuery TouchSwipe

I use [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) for DOM traversal and manipulation etc. (No surprise there I'm sure.) I use [JQuery TouchSwipe](http://labs.rampinteractive.co.uk/touchSwipe/demos/), a little jquery plugin for handling touch events on touch sensitive devices, to add some behaviours on swipe to this site.

## Supported browsers

Supports recent versions of all major browsers.

Tested in Chrome 35, Firefox 29, IE 8-11, Opera 12, Safari 5, Chrome for Android 35, Android Internet Browser 4.
