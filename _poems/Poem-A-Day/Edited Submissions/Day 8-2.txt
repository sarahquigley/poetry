Day 8



	Day 8 by ~a-random-quigle



I left the village of Sadness (Lost and Found)
and crossed the billowing Shoelace Plains
until I reached the cotton turrets of
Pantaloon Castle.
There, they say, the king holds court
on a trouser throne
and the queen drinks underwear tea for breakfast.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Sir Knight, only you.”

I travelled day, I travelled night,
across the valley where the shirtghosts flit,
past the googly-eyed buttonmen,
through the darkness of the Unpaired Forest.
There umbrellatrees with socks for leaves 
dance and squawk with shoebirds,
stiletto beaked and cruel.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Mista’ Knight, only you.”

I travelled day, I travelled night,
(until there yawned the funeralsilk lair)
(until there yawned a terrible site
the paisley teeth of the blacksilk lair
of the terrible tartan coatmonster)
until I came to the funeralsilk lair
of the terrible tartan coatmonster.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked
“No,” he growled “but I’d sure like to,
she sounds deee-licious.”
(I'd like to pick her hangers clean
I'd like to rummage in her drawers)
("No" he roared "but if I did 
I'd rummage in her dresser
I'd pounce on her/ catch her/ eat her/ I'd tear apart/open/ slice open her closet doors
and pick her hangers clean")
Then I slew the beast
and I travelled home
to my hut in the village of Sadness

where I tore apart your drawers,
picked every hanger clean,
where I folded your castles, your forests
and your beasts
away 
in black plastic bin-liners.

and there I 
you were lost and I was found

where I folded castles ghosts and beasts
into the attic drawers / a chest of drawers
still my heart
folded in my chest
beat not
for a love that's lost


and there I found a chest of drawers
where folded need and clean

I packed away castels ghots and beast
and unpacked the folded ventricles
of slightly broken heart
and put it back inside my chest

[Incensed I brandished scabbard
he gnashed his paisley teeth
I ducked and dodged and dive
and with a single sweep
I cut/sliced right of his coat tails
and then I slew the beast]
