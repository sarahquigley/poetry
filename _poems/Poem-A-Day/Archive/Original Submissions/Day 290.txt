Day 290

Short things

Long swathes of verse frighten me-
they're too heavy for my small hands
it's a dog fight,
pitt-bull verses pug-
It being Christmas I think of hard
candy canes-
I keep setting them down
wrapping them up,
returning again and again to suck them down,
it's unappealing, they congeal
it takes days to eat one.
Better to retreat to big bags
of small soft candy,
gums that will not break my teeth.

I like things that wear short dresses
that do not seem to hide a thing
that seem unseemly

I like to wear short dresses
and perhaps I do not hide a thing
and perhaps I seem unseemly

Things that wear short dresses

Snowdrops.
Robins that hop right into the house
through the back door,
that eat crumbs right from the counter.
Nipples erect - no bra.
Walnuts, cracked from their shell,
half broken during the process.
Small pert poems,
The moon, still visible
though it is bright out
Young children.
