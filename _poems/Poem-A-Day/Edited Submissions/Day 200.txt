Day 200

Why I want to be a man

So a quick flick genetics lesson here,
and it's probably no surprise to the women out there,
to learn that men are a few genes short-
yes, Y is just an X that's got the chop...
funny then that men, though chromosomally neutered,
are the ones with the dick and bollocks.

That said, I was reading an article
in Trends in Cognitive Science the other day
discussing how men are systematic and women empathic,
there's real scientific evidence they say-
and oh man, to walk around oblivious
to all the emotional shtick
that we build out of air and our own insecurities,
and oh man, to walk around oblivious to the petty politics
of our grim little everyday lives
would be my idea of heaven,
and so, given the opportunity,
I'd castrate my X without a second thought.
