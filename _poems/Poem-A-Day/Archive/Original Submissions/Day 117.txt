Day 117

Poem 1

Autumn

the unnoticed brown
of a little man, wrinkled,
dithering over the tea



Poem 2

I walked to the Stephen&#146;s Green on Sunday,
the seagulls dipped and dived and stole
bread from the ducks.

I trudged the sediments of my life,
kicked stones into the pond.
On the bridge, a little Asian girl

smiled and asked me for the time,
I told her two fifty five.
