Day 194



	Day 194 by *a-random-quigle



At ETA two minutes
you can see the DART approaching
in Shankill Station,
beady eyes emerging from the darkness-
and as the doors open, 
the train becomes Medusa in the inverse,
snakedy snake toy snake, waving strands of human.

It&#039;s uncomfortable to be out in the open
on nights like this, so dark is it-
the shadows have shadows
and the shadows of shadows surely have beasts.
The city is shadow
and a worm of a shadow
of a shadow of a shadow
crawls up your nose,
makes bed with you.
All night long it lays little eggs
in your head. 

The new moon is a safety pin,
bent and straining-
any minute now the seams will burst
and the stuffing will pour out.
Who&#039;s to say what blackened beasts lurk
in the vastness of that sky?
