Day 325



	Day 325 by *a-random-quigle



There must be a man
who rubs ointment on lion paws,
or sweeps the queen bee's lair,
who tries to hook wise old fish,
but finds currents everywhere-
the most beautiful work!

The most beautiful work!
There must be a man
who runs the sun,
greases it
and sweeps it clean,
who reels flaring wisps in!
