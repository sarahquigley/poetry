Day 153



	Day 153 by *a-random-quigle



Little bird, blue coat, white throat,
playing cradle in the yard,
your claws make new shapes
of that tangle-

calm fish, old dog,
hooked horse in the kelpweed,
lace whale open mouthed
sifting dreams from the ether.

Little bird, bright claws, goodbeak,
I&#146;m almost certain
you could make music
of those strings.

You gather me up,
I hang in a crib of your claws
above a rolling ocean-
a gust blows, rocking me,
and buoyed by the wind, excited,
you toss me overboard- sing!
Your music is a lifeboat,
I am drowned and I am saved again.

Little bird, song weaver, worn out
playing cradle in the yard,
you tame the cat&#146;s bed
and build a strong nest to rest in.
