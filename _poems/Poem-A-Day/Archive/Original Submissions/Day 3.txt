Day 3



	Day 3 by ~a-random-quigle



Evening is shuffling its way to cold
Night is snuffling for scarves and gloves
and thermal underwear
Trees droop in the half-light
limp fingers caressing 
the windows of double-decker buses
Tap tap titter
Teenagers
Rain
The walk home along
murky mucky
paths
Tinned
soup
Wet socks
silence
