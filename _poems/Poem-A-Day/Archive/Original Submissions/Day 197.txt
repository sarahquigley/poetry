Day 197



	Day 197 by *a-random-quigle



Water as a mixer

I don&#039;t know how I got into this mood
but I want to seem clever
and I want to seem cool-

strangers tossing names,
the room is a pond rippling, 
rippling-
tell me I am water, dazzling, dazzling,
swallowing stones and fishing hooks.

Rogue music (doododoodoo) rogue music,
philosophically stunted,
morally blunted,
selfish but gay,
hey hey hey!

Tell me my words are slinking cats,
winding fish,
navigating tires and whales
serenely
pristinely.

Tell me I am a water, drippling
drippling,
tell me no one can see my fish,
no one can catch my coloured fish,
my coloured fish.

How easily mouth is torn from tail-
everyone can see the guts and bones,
they spill into the room
and splay.
Road music (doododoodoo) road music...
