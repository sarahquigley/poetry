Day 12



	Day 12 by ~a-random-quigle



sunrise
a flamingo flaps
on the horizon

breakfast
seaweed floats
on the milkwhite sea

afternoon
the sun plays
this-little-piggy
on our bare toes

dinner
the clock tower stretches
across the market square

sunset
orange plastic flaps
on an empty building site

night
coffee 
sits forgotten
on the stove
