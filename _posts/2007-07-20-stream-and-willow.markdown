    and Willow
subtitle: for Joanna Newsom
excerpt: |
  The moon is bright –
  oh the moon is my night light
---

The moon is bright –  
oh the moon is my night light  
which I hang from a string  
as I simmer and sing  
through the darkness,

and the willows are strings  
which I pluck as I sing  
and the rocks are a drum  
which you thrum –

your hand is a cup  
oh you gather me up  
your lips are abrupt,  
and I simmer and sing  
as you drink,

and the willows are strings  
which I pluck as I sing  
and the rocks are a drum  
which you thrum,

oh the rocks are a drum  
which you thrum as you run  
and the reeds are forever parting.
