Day 349
Riddle

These pearls travel fast around the fingers of our city,
these pearls travel fast.
These pearls are lit from the inside by electricity,
these pearls are lit from the inside.

These pearls carry little passengers
and they carry neat briefcases of carefully creased
information - instructions,
how to make a man,
how to make a woman-
and Father drives the beads
and Mother keeps the tracks and station.

Shall we cut these pearls free?
Shall we cut them free?
What are we?
What are we now?
Derailed.
