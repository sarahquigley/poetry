Day 61



	Day 61 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

gardener
librarian
cleaning woman
recluse

reckless
with words



Poem 2

rain

chattering teeth
nervous feet
on the slates



Poem 3

lukewarm wives

Distasteful,
pots of coffee
in the kitchen,

and you drink
them anyway
to assuage your guilt

for making,
forgetting,
leaving
to go cold.
