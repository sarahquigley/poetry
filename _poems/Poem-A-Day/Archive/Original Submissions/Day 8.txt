Day 8



	I left the village of Sadness
and crossed the billowing shoelace plains
until I reached the cotton turrets of
Pantaloon Castle.
There, they say, the king holds court
on a trouser throne
and the queen drinks underwear tea for breakfast.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Sir Knight, only you.”

I travelled day, I travelled night,
around the valley where the shirtghosts flit,
past the googly-eyed buttonmen,
through the darkness of the Unpaired Forest.
There umbrellatrees with socks for leaves 
dance and squawk with shoebirds,
stiletto beaked and cruel.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Mista’ Knight, only you.”

I travelled day, I travelled night,
until I came to the funeralsilk lair
of the terrible tartan coatmonster.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked
“No,” he said “but I’d sure like to,
she sounds deee-licious.”
Then I slew the beast
and I travelled home
to my hut in the village of Sadness

where I tore apart your drawers,
picked every hanger clean,
where I folded your castles, your forests
and your beasts
away 
in black plastic bin-liners.
