Day 191



	Day 191 by *a-random-quigle



Every morning I stand, shivering a little, measuring up my body.
Is my bum a little bigger? Are my breasts a little smaller?
Is it my imagination or is the skin on my thighs a little rougher?
It&#039;s a good thing there&#039;s no way for me to examine my insides-
or I might be there all day, checking out my heart, my kidneys,
my digestive tract. Is it my imagination or is my liver a little bigger?
