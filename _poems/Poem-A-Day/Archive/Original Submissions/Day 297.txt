Day 297



	Day 297 by *a-random-quigle



Who can say what size a quail egg is
unless they&#039;ve weighed one in their hands
twirled it round a little,
measured it in fingers?

I think they must be small and speckled,
tinted with a hint of blue,
but that might be another bird&#039;s egg
I have cracked a few.
