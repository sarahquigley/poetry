one summer
he cleared a beach for you
your father
back bare stooped
his scalp likeleather
hefting rocks


of salt and sand, 
Your childhood not mine-
So/Too easy to forget 
it was you that trundled home
spilling buckets of rock shrimp,
you decorated this house with
waveworn flowers of coral,
you placed that husk of a crab
on the windowsill

it is many summers now
since your father
bare-backed
his scalp like leather
hefted rocks from the sand
to make a beach/your own little private beach 
since he white washed the walls
and painted the eaves red
 



Seaweed, salt sand
rock pool
sprat
periwinkle
barnacle
crab

weed thatched

salt pearled/stung/strung

pebble-dashed

wind broken

What's the need for soap
the wind will sweep skin clean
what's the need for diamonds
the ocean will spray me with pearls

The Summer House

Of salt and sand, of peat smoke,
your childhood not mine-
so easy to forget-
it was you that trundled home
spilling buckets of rock shrimp,
you decorated this house with
waveworn flowers of coral,
you placed that husk of a crab
on the windowsill.

Weedthatched, saltstrung,
pebbledashed, windbroken-
many summers have passed since you,
sleaves rolled to your elbows,
skin tanned to leather,
cleared stones from the path
to the Graveyard Beach
and whitewashed the walls.



poor 

the ocean provides
periwinkles, salt pearls
