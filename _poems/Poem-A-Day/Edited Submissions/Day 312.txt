Day 312



	Day 312 by *a-random-quigle



The whales have built a forest from their spume,
and Monkeys know that trees are built for climbing,
that trees heave with sticky fruit,
to climb those trees would be the thing,
thought Monkey.

Can you swim?
Can you swim? Fold a boat
from Elephant leaves and loose it to the wind.
Is it the wind that sings?
