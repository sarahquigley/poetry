Day 11



	Day 11 by ~a-random-quigle



There was once a Bear who was hungry,
the berries were long plucked dry
and his fur hung lankly from his
skeletal frame.
In desperation he climbed to the top of
the Bronze Mountain,
"No one will notice 
one less star."
He picked a single star from the sky
and popped it between his
fat brown lips,
it was bright and juicy as anything-
but a single star cannot fill the stomach of
a hungry Bear.
Just one more star, just one more star-
he picked another- then another,
each one was brighter and 
juicier than the next.
He ate and ate and ate until his stomach bulged,
a clean black sheet hung above his head
as he settled down to sleep for winter.

From his perch in the Silver Tree,
the Owl watched the Bear jealously-
the Owl was hungry too.
"Who needs the moon,
when you have eyes that shine
as bright and clear as mine?"
he said,
so he flew up and up and up
and pecked at the moon
until all that was left
was a pock-marked
skeleton-
he pecked and pecked and pecked
until the moon fell to the earth
in a silky snow.

From his den in the Golden Forest,
the Fox watched the Owl and the Bear intently-
the Fox was not hungry at all.
In fact he had just eaten 
an enormous and juicy rabbit
and three small guinea fowl,
he was still picking the flesh
from his teeth.
"Why should the Owl and the Bear
have all the fun?"
he thought to himself,
so as the sky turned red with dusk
out he crept-
he leapt
and, in one enormous bite,
he swallowed the sun down whole,
And that was the end of that.

(A mournful voice floated up from the emptiness
"Who needs the sun when your fur 
burns with a fire 
like mine?")
