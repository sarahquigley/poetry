Poem 1

If giant sentient robots were female

Oh, it is a shiny necklace
such bright pearls,
I must have it.

And yanking the train
from its tracks
she fastens it 
about her neck.

Oh it looks perfect
dahling
divine.



Poem 2

December&#039;s lovers

June, and I&#039;m still picking 
pine needles from the cracks
between the floorboards,
from behind the radiator,
I go at them with the hoover
stubborn buggers,

one or two are bold 
they lie there
in the middle of the floor
sun-bathing -

you brought us in,
you breathed of us
sweet December scents,
you throw us out
so easily,

have you no last
sprig of love
or at least
of pity.
