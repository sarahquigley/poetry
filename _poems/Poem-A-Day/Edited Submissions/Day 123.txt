Day 123



	Day 123 by *a-random-quigle



A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
a small bird flashes,
the hawthorn shakes
a little.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
the treasure is sweet and yellow,
she emerges bedecked, crowned,
but not queened.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
petal parter, pollen bringer,
womb caresser.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
their mouths open for her,
pause in mid chew,
then spit.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
oh your sister&#146;s on a pub crawl,
she gets so drunk,
her clothes get all mussed.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
a bee a bee bee bee
buzzes.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
the hive song welcomes her back 
drunk into its buzzing darkness,
pulse dance rub kiss.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
there are echoes of her in the air,
a buzzing on
my lips.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
and stings,
a bee burrows and stings,
a bee stings oh.

A bee burrows bloom to bloom-
she drains the cups and sets them down,
she doesn&#146;t do the washing.
