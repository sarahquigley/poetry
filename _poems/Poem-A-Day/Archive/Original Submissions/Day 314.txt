Day 314



	Day 314 by *a-random-quigle



Pelican carried stones in his pocket

two scooped from a rock pool
once the darting homes of thin fish
a perch for seagrass

three more plucked from the ledge of a cliff
thin glistening, nesting treasure
gifts for birdwife
another from the sky

I am a rough tough thief, Pelican puffed
jangling his pocket about
stone music spilled across the waves

tinkling.
