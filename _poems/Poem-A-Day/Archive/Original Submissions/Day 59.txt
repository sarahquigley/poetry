Day 59



	Day 59 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

Get those big words out of my face,
cover them up
and don’t let me spot
even one pert letter poking through
that thin veil of modesty.

You’re just jealous because
you’re not so well
endowed.



Poem 2

rustling hedge
low growl

deep

low hedge
rustling growl



Poem 3

Caller ID broken

Or dumb
to be accurate

unable to recognise
to connect
names
voices

left
with 
the grim
embarrassment
of the unknown.
