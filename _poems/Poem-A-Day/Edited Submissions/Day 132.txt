Day 132



	Day 132 by *a-random-quigle



the evening curls inwards
oh wonderful, a shaft of light
penetrates the water
a shaft of light steps
as we rock and blow
in the waves we made

the floor has struck storm
and tosses with shirt
skirt skin oh wonderful

and suddenly we&#039;re shipwrecked
and everything we&#039;ve ever loved
is tossed up on the shore

answer me these questions three
does the flower love the bee
does the sun have spider legs
and will they come and question me
if I say I&#039;ve crossed the swimming sea
