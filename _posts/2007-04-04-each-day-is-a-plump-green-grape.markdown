Each day is a  
                plump  
                     green   
               grape  
to be plucked  
         and pressed  
                between lips  
            to be  
    rolled   
on the tongue  
     popped   
          between teeth  
        inhaled   
like a good woman

(sometimes it will be messy)  
celebrate the sweet juice  
slipping down your chin  

lick it  
     celebrate  
           and take another grape.
