Day 254



	Day 254 by *a-random-quigle



I have a man who weighs
like a stone in the hand
smooth, hard heavy
man.

I want a man
who doesn&#039;t shake the blinds-
a narrow man,
he slips between shafts
of bamboo
like a subtle affair.

This swollen affair
will do- moonlight bulges
through bamboo,
this swollen affair is mine.
