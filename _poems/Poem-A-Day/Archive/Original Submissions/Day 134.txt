Day 134



	Day 134 by ~a-random-quigle



Slightly they seeped from the mp3 player
and I bucketed drips
and I emptied fortnightly-
suddenly your songs were overspilling
and no amount of bucket running
and no amount of towel sponging
could stop them-

suddenly the room was ten feet deep
and oh I was thinking
the carpets will take days to dry out
and I&#146;ll be dusting your chords
from the corners for weeks-
and oh god, my new cream curtains
will be permanently stained
with wild horses and plum juice-
for a while silence kept me afloat
a boat which wildly I bailed.

Alice cried a sea of tears,
you sing a sea that laps the ears
in rolling waves,
oh my room is awash
oh my room is aslosh
and silence is sunken
a boat to the bottom,
I&#146;m lost.

I was thinking
that I&#146;d send you an email
and invite you around,
though I fear you might
think me presumptuous,
if you come wear one of your dresses
and pin your voice like a jewel securely-
you wouldn&#146;t want to drop that.

Do you wanna come down
oh won&#146;t you come down
oh please come down
and sail with me in a sunken boat
built of silence...

we&#146;ll toss out lines
and try to catch a crescendo unawares,
sloughing her scales on my dresser
and slipping between shoals
of adjectives and semitones,
we&#146;ll cook her for dinner
on a smoke fire
and giggle-

do you wanna come down
oh won&#146;t you come down
oh please come down Joanna
and fish with me in this silvering sea
of your songs...
