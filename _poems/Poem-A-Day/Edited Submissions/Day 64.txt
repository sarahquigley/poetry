Day 64

Poem 1

City 14

The city is full
of aliens -

they powder their
scaly noses

and spit into
pink mobile phones.



Poem 2

City 15

The suburbs are full
of fog -

it fingers the houses.

The city is full
of smog -

it fingers the side streets,
grubby pawed.



Poem 3

City 16

The city is full
of fingers,

tapping at laptops
in cafés,

fiddling with grass
in the park,

skimming over spines
in the bookshop,

waving,
lovers' knots,

grubby fingers
reaching for beer
or cigarettes
or money,
drugs

and slipping carelessly
up women’s cracks.
