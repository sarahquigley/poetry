Day 36



	Day 36 by ~a-random-quigle



Poem 1

supper on the roof

we lie on 
our island of slate 
and watch
cranes swinging in the sun 
and a magpie stuttering from chimney to chimney

a boat sails on a river of white wine
and takeaway Chinese noodles 
criss-cross the sky
on
chopsticks

as the day flows by



Poem 2

The trees are bursting into leaf,
a million firework shows
in green, gold and purple
green
everywhere we go.

The trees are bursting into song,
a million bright balloons,
a million wild romances,

flowers bulge and burst too soon.
