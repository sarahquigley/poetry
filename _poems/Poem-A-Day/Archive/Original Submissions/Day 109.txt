Ghosts


I

She piles her hair on her head
and clips a stray into place,
thanking god for this miracle
of elastic that clings
and smoothes.



II

A slug smoothes
through the night,
white.



III

Windows are a land of their own,
islands and ghost-whiffed headlands
strung in a sea of elsewhere,
streetlights headlights -
reality strikes in small wet sparks
as you slink from your shelter.



IV

Sometimes I haunt Libero&#146;s 
clacking my heels tapping my toes -
and the fat Indian, the slick Korean
behind the counter seem to skirt
me with their eyes,
afraid to settle on this odd
night visitor -
greasy men pick up their takeaway
stare at their toes drive on,
hello I say hello.
