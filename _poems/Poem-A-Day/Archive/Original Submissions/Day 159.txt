Day 159

it is a familiar dance
midges circle
each other in the yard

the eaves are dripping
the last days of summer
rot in the damp

the drift of leaves
the seeping from eaves
the long plod home

we move from
car to kitchen table
we eat our peas

we fuck under the eaves
midges circle
it is a familiar dance
