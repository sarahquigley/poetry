   On Leaving 
---

It's all a matter of how quickly
and how carefully -

a dish on a counter,
a strand on a pillow,
the dry stone of a plum -

a light in a window,
a half eaten pear, 
a seed in the ground -

a tree who, excepting the slight
of the sawman,
will outlive us 
and will never leave our door -

a tree whose branches,
so rugged and strong,
stretch from the seashore
to the foot of a door
now barred and broken -

My love, hear orchards whisper!
When fruit burst from branches,
remember mine on yours.
