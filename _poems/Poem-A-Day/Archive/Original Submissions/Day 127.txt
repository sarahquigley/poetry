Day 127



	Day 127 by *a-random-quigle



fox meets cat

grey sleek
in the shadows by the tree
rubbing and pacing,
we meet eye to eye
over the fishgold remains
of someone&#146;s evening,
rotting, stinking up the side
street, delicious, lingering,

we are not so different you and i,
we wander and we eat
