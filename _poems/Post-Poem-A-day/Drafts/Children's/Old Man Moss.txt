Old Man Moss was taking
his beard out for a walk
a beard that isn't walked each day
as I'm sure you are aware
gets very very long
and gets in the way
a similar phenomenon to/ a little bit like people
who never take the air
getting very fat
like you'd get very fat

beards are handy things to walk
because they always walk to heal
so you do not need a lead for them

and Old Man Moss's beard
was very very long
since he often forgot to walk it
in preference for sitting on a rock
and thinking about walks
he found that walks
when done in thought
were very grand indeed
but a little less grand in practise
they did so strain the knees

but today was a very fine day for walking
since the sun was very high and hot
and not so very good for sitting
since it left you rather parched
sitting with the beaming sun
baking your green beard

he was out in search of water
a beard that isn't watered
can't possibly stay bright and bushy / verdant / green
and Old Man Moss was careful to keep his beard pristine


Old Man Moss was walking
when he met a passing stream
what will I do Moss said
this stream is in my way
and so he thought and thought and thought
why a stream that means there's water / that equals water
perfect he said this hits the spot
and indeed it did
he dipped is beard right in the stream
and it mopped it up
until there was nothing left at all
except a tiny trickle
that won't do Old Man Moss said
and so he dipped his hair
and soaked up everything there was
until it wasn't there
the ground didn't even dribble

and a terrible sob was heard
and a single tear was cried
Old Man Moss how could you
you've drunk my river dry?
how will I feed my children

Oh Lady Mountain/Mildew/Fern/Lichen please do forgive
I never realised
that this stream belonged to another
sob your tear no longer
I know the thing to do
I don't even need to ponder

In his two shaggy hands
Moss grasped his beard
in his two shaggy hands
he rung it
and from his beard a river flowed
right back to where it had flown before
there was a river once more

I hope that we are friends again
Oh Lady Lichen
one mountain to another
