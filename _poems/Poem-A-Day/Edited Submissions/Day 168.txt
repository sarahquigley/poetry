Day 168

Poem 1

giant sentient flying robots eat fancy

serving dinner in the sky,
a tablecloth of blue-
clouds of bread, a mustard sun (our dipping sauce)
for dipping,
(skyscrapers are best when fried)
chomp chomp chomp
delicious



Poem 2

Old man bats an eye
at the pot of sky,
it is not a tasty stew.

It is a bag of nothing
all bones, a little meat
to fool the eye.



Poem 3

Day old bread and summer wine
in the forest of the dead,
we wed beneath an ancient sky,
I kiss the stone,
you suck the bone,
and as I knit into the earth,
and as I stretch towards the sky,
I feel my fingers touch the sun.
