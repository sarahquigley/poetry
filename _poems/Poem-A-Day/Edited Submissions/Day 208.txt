Day 208



	Day 208 by *a-random-quigle



1

white moon drips
melts down
your neck


2

all fall
gently
to dust

shivering
the streets
are chrome

on windows
ice drips
down

the sky
crumbled 
on the ground

indoors talk of love
of biscuit base
bake

on windows
ice drips
down

all fall
gently
home again
