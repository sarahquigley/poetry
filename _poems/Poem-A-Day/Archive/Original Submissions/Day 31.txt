Day 31



	Day 31 by ~a-random-quigle



Spring / Fall

a budding leaf
tiny fingers
clasped around mine

april snow
dandelions shed
their first seed

white hair bare scalps
we all dance the dance we do 
until we go home



a last leaf
swept away
by a passing car

bonfire night
small mushrooms
bloom and curl to the sky

white hair bare scalps
we all dance the dance we do
until we go home
