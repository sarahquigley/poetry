Tiresias

west of the meadows
beneath the railway
roosevelt street beneath the silt of commuters
shifting in and out the city 
invisible to the commuters above
that shift in and out
over the city
like the tides oblivious
to the crabs beneath the rocks
and the sand worms
and the shrimp that nibble algae from the rocks


an old pug crunches the thin scraps
of a chinese lady smoothing the petals
of paper sunflowers

the commuters look down
and the iddlers look up
right at you in the eye
until you feel compelled to look away


a child takes rabbit bites
from a churro
a white haired baker, flour haired
cuts pieces from the baklava
a grandmother straightens her sari
a cyclists runs two red lights
a rack of t-shirts topples over
knocking sunglasses everywhere
a thin-boned chinese ladies
straightens a vase full of paper sunflowers
an old dog crunches chicken bones


the kiss of the monarch
Poetry of the ego
poetry of the id
it is high time
we left the blind man
muttering the doorways
and turned our heads
towards the sun

Tiresias

do you, nervously,
study/follow the distant parting/kiss of gulls
when caught in the eye
by a black man/negro or a hispanic
do I

Oh it is high time
we left the blind men
muttering in the doorways
and turned our heads
towards the sun

West of the Meadows
beneath the railway tracks
a blind man digs for spoons
with his fingers
a child runs backwards
