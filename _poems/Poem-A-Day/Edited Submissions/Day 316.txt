Day 316



	Day 316 by *a-random-quigle



Do you remember
behind the house was a little place
a half shackled shed and a washing line
so twisted on itself
that it might have made a nest for the little birds
that came to rest with a quick shudder

Do you remember
a pool where once red fish had puckered
lips now thick with pond weed 
hairy and slick with rising mud
the flowers had turned wild
so we picked them and pressed them in books
