Day 263

So I closed things
like the front door
and my bank account-
I closed the back door too,
just to leave me no alternative.


---


I want a man to pull me aside and say
Sarah, I just want to fuck you-
that's it.

And then we can fuck
or I can tell him to fuck off-
it doesn't really matter which
at that point.


---


Love can be heavy handed sometimes-
it's a spring thing,
bluebells bluebell
daffodil-
no need to look further
than my own swinging thighs-


---


I haven't cursed those little barnacles
that roughen rocks
in too long-
I haven't cursed those loose periwinkles
how will I grow thick soles?


---


The sun was my first lover
I spread myself on glassy mornings
and absorbed-
and I won't say that the rays
were grass snakes,
but you know, close enough.

But now that I think about it
was it the grass?
I remember rolling in you.
Or the hedges?
I remember cushioning falls
spiky branches poking into me.

That begs the question,
was it the leaves?
Autumn made the most of you
and I too.
I vote fingers over leaves,
either way.
