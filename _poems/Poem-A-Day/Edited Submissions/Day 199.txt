Day 199

My father&#039;s mother

When I think of my grandmother
I think of my mother&#039;s mother
all soft tiered and smiling,
smelling of menopause.
In the mornings she would bring me fruit,
and I would burrow into her,
listen for her heartbeat and her stories.

I don&#039;t think of the other one-
she exists only
in hobbling wispy-haired memories,
or in the hospital bed, spread-eagled.
Sorry Gran,
it&#039;s not that I&#039;ve forgotten you,
it&#039;s more that I never really knew you in the first place.
