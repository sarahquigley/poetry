Day 348



	Day 348 by *a-random-quigle


from rock and fern
scuttle dry black beetles

the morning sun polishes
the kiss of silvering slugs
this is the treasure
this is the juicy fruit

coal and diamonds
diamonds coal dust
merge and mingle
in the muck

keep your bright beaks sharp
dusty little miners
