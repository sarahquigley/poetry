Day 6



	Day 6 by ~a-random-quigle



a beard and floppy hair
passing through airport security,
an odd assortment of things-
watercolour pencils,
a perfumed fan,
a battered condom,
three small rubber balls,
rainbow boxer shorts.

on my coffee break
i count suitcases,
identify obscure accents,
eavesdrop on tales of
honeymoons in Venice and
holiday flings-

i think of your eyes
(what colour were they now?),
your voice as you grunted,
is this going to take very long?
my plane takes off in 10 minutes-

i weigh you, roll you in my palms,
and you have all the turbulence of a song
i can’t quite remember-
