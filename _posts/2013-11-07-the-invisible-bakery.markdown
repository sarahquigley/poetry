   The Invisible
   Bakery 
---

Bushwick wears its own cologne,  
a delicate infusion of fish guts  
and the unsorted trash of local history  
accumulating in gutters,  

But then there's the Butter Street,  
the Invisible Bakery, the air celebrates  
the swift movements of floured hands,  
folding and rolling and folding again.
