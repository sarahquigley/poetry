Day 56

I
Coat

Lover
all winter I’ve lived coddled
in your tatty nooks.

You did so fine a job
of warming and loving
that I’ve forgotten
how to be bare
exposed,

summer’s a time
for scandalous dresses,
summer’s a time
for leaving home.


II

Your little white clapper
of a Renault Four
takes the road
at its own pace,

let them sound their horns, you say,
summer’s a time for strolling.


III

My father,
for all his gruffness,
notices when the hawthorns
smell sweet.
