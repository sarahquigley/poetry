Day 268



	Day 268 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

A quarter of a cantaloupe
makes a caravelle

Grass dolls sail downstream
an innocent voodoo

Pray that orange deck
meets the sun
on new shores



Poem 2

Mother would take a fork
to her watermelon
and pick out every seed,
even those shrivelled
white boys-
sometimes it&#039;s easier
to bury yourself in &#039;em
and spit out the seed.
