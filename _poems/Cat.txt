A cats small sharp claws
bite pinholes in the cage of night
and light slips through
itself slim demure and cat like
our sealed world now broken
we become aware of a multitude of stars
oh world beyond the only one we know


boats rock, love slips from side to side
and through the holes in this sieve
through cracks we failed to mend
to join a larger ocean
when we took her up to dry dock
we've come to dwell in
stretched taught like leather on a drying rack


A cat, to come 
to know his size,
bends many whiskers
and breaks a few

How can I package this/you for him/you
oh/the unexpected sun on rainyswept/rainwet/ streets
oh/the/and sticky dew on slippery feet
oh/the simple curve of supple lips
that knows the roll of a lover's kiss
a tongue that's tasted blackberries
and fish 


and slippery feet
