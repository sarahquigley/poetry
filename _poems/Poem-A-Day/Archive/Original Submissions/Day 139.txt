Day 139

Poem 1

Disco dogs

The air was filled with a raucous laughter
as we removed our hats and coats,
it bayed.

Beautiful, a city of looms,
shadows warped by light and music,
a fabric built of shaft and sound.

We wove our arms and beat our feet
oh ecstasies, we were complete,
knotted and contained.

It was a jointed dance
and us mechanical,
cut from cardboard, hung on strings.



Poem 2

Paper plane

My page was spiral bound
contained-
destination certain, safety arranged.

But you with roving fingers
tore me from my bindings,
folded and floated I was free.

I wasn&#146;t built for origami.



Poem 3

Oh what an effort it is to set to print,
to hold between fingertips
sets me trembling, confused-
how to proceed?

Should I sprout like a seed,
watered and wintered?
Should I sail like a ship
buoyed and braced
by the waters?
Should I knot like a vine
on a trellis of strings?

I&#146;ll dance like a bird,
a crackling nest will I build
from beetle and plum and milky moon,
words will be my livingroom.



Poem 4

Have faith,
you will be clever again,
perhaps not today
and perhaps not tomorrow,
but again and again,
there will be other dishes
and battles and men.
