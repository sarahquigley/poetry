A machine torn straight from the pages  
of the War of the Worlds,  
it has dug claws into the soil of old Dundrum  
and hunkered down on its haunches.  

St. George's Bells peel its arrival.  
Spider on spider on spider,  
little feet disturb hairs  
on the back of my hands,  
and ivy sinks first roots  
into concrete - the webs we weave,

the bridges new lovers build for each other,  
rigging stretches to the sky  
and wind plays the cables like a harp.  
It is like a beached ship, you whispered.  
Before it landed here on our small planet,  
a sail of purest whitest energy  
stretched from that thin curved mast,  
I replied.

Those pillars hide the shaft of a glass elevator  
and, deep in the caverns they have hollowed  
beneath the streets of Dundrum,  
small fat-eyed men with silver suits and laser guns  
watch us as we make love on the tracks  
of Dundrum Luas bridge-  
stars pulsing above us,  
cars pulsing below  
and Mars hovering, unblinking,  
an ever-watchful eye.
