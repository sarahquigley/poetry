Day 274

Poem 1

You&#039;ll write letters to me
and I imagine we will in the future
be able to distil
the love away, gold juice,
and leave only words,
like eggshells, to scrunch
under toes.


Poem 2

Chaos, lover,
has reordered our clothes-
disarray has left me wearing bedsheets!

(Your jeans are riding llamas in Peru,
my bra is in Barbados.)
