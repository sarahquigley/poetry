Day 136

There's something I've learned
with a little experience,
though this may seem a little heinous,
anything can be a penis...
traffic lights, an ice cream cone,
those chubby little garden gnomes,
chimney pots and tubas-
and then there's the obvious
squidgy worms and sausage rolls,
every obelisk and bone,
oh Freud would tumble in his grave
if I claimed this cane
was just a cane.
