Day 118

Poem 1

Is it wrong to want rain
in the summer,
to want to rustle,
to drip? Pock me -
dent this soft earth
with fat kisses.
Come- pool in the curves
of my stomach, between
the lips of my navel.
Let me be wet all night,
all day - catch chills,
make spills.
If Old Geras comes to call,
we&#039;ll drown him,
flush him out to sea.



Poem 2 

With my dustpan I&#039;ll sweep
the crumbs of you away
under the carpet,
I&#039;ll pick your hairs from my sheets
and hoover you from the cracks
between the floorboards.
I&#039;ll shower, scrub you from my skin,
exfoliate every last caress, kiss,
clean you from beneath my nails.
I&#039;ll trace the curves of your cursive
and toss them all away.
