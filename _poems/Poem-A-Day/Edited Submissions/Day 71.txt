Day 71



	Day 71 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

things that are like men

rough stone walls
buttons
catkins spurted across dry summer grass
a hot creaking bed
flapping fish



Poem 2

crick crick crick
white flash 
seed splash



Poem 3

I stand in the doorway, smoking, avoiding
the stares of the slick Korean
on the mobile phone,
and looking, as far as I’m concerned,
like some fine thing with a dozen friends
and twice as many men 
waiting back inside that warm red pub.

Buses pull up and strangers pour out,
giggling, hugging, holding hands -
I watch them and pick at the gaps 
in their teeth, their wrinkles,
snigger silently at last minute boots
over hours of splotchy fake tan
and fat thighs hoisted into leggings.

Then, I crush my loneliness into the pavement
and walk on 

another pub,
another doorway.

I forget.
