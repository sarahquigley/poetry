Day 167

Poem 1

I sit by the river,
my courtiers
bowing and kissing before me-
their proboscis leave red kisses
on my toes
that itch itch itch.



Poem 2

At three a.m. you reheat your soup-
the shade disguises the gentle flirtations
of moth and light,
the ghost of shadow
moving from wall to wall,
shuddering a little.
