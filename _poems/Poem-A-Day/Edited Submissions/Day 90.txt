Two poems of childhood


I

From its turrets, I watched clouds pass
and birds build houses 
and July slowly fade her way into August.

Then I discovered a hidden hatch,
peered inside to find darkness-
what adventures went
on within the walls of my castle?

Two torturous weeks I contained myself,
freedom was giving way to trousers
and school uniforms
and soon my chances would evaporate
into hours of long division and spelling,
one drizzly day I cracked,

I gathered pebbles from the gravel drive
and one by one by one
dropped them into the abyss
plop plop plop
plop 

an ocean lapped inside my castle!
An ocean where spiders sailed the darkness
on boats of leaf and web-

ah Father, you wondered why the oil tank tinkled
when we moved it.



II

Weapons ready and faces streaked with dirt,
tribal braves, fearless,
we pelted our enemies with leaves, pebbles,
mud.

Mark was the first as always, but hours of begging 
soon payed their dues for all,
our lives were changed by the arrival of the
water pistol.

Thrust forward through the centuries, we became 
cowboys or soldiers,
we fought birds and cars and dogs
and one heady day we fought Mr. Maguire,

he sprayed us with his garden hose
and gave Michael a right beating.
