Day 133



	Day 133 by ~a-random-quigle



We wear our good shoes,
we drink all the right booze,
but then use all the right forks
at all the wrong times-
or all the wrong forks
at all the right times, who knows,
we&#146;ve stiffened our chances
with the starch of our eyes.

The evening has nested
in the palm of the bay,
now the dark is romancing-
boats cross the horizon,
lights kissing and parting
and planes merge with the city
as they sink from the sky-
we feel like the stone
in the night&#146;s eye,

from the burgeoning blackness
a train cracks the silence
and shadows cough
as we let fly our goodbyes-
that peck of politeness,
of habitual kindness
lands empty and old,
cold.
