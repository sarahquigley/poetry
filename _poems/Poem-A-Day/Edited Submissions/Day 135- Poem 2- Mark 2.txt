Day 135- Poem 2- Mark 2



	Day 135- Poem 2- Mark 2 by ~a-random-quigle



Day opens like a gull
world is new-
in the hazing of the morning
in the harbour without warning
bird boat shell
bird boat shell
ring the ear like a church bell.

The air is rough 
the sand folds soft
we pack supplies
rope pot spyglass 
rope pot spyglass 
every step is an adventure
as we dodge the breaker foam.

Sun blooms like an anemone
world is new
world is new-
an unchewed bone a polished stone
which we toss and we skip on the water
bird boat shell
bird boat shell.

And suddenly and sullenly
and sadly she wrinkles,
the world feels shadowed
curled periwinkled-
great dark clouds
great dark clouds
and every story has an ending
and every game grows cold
and every game grows old.
