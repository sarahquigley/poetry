Poem 1

The waitresses smile at you here,
and the old beggars are honest men
saving for a pint of cider.



Poem 2

The Magicman had a rat in his hat,
a scarab beetle lodged up his nose
and giant gold coin stuck behind his ear.

The Magicman had a frog in his throat-
he croaked
and out it hopped!
It was a coloured frog
with bright blue spots!
A space frog with laser vision!
A dryad frog with acorn
eyes, bark skin, leafy toes...

It was a magic frog
and it did magic things,
like disappear and reappear
under your hat, behind your ear-
ghost frog, flying frog
with webbed wings,
bat frog, sea frog, bumblebee frog!

And with a single slight of hand, 
a normal little garden frog-
and off it hopped to do normal
little garden things,
catch dragonflies
and sing.
