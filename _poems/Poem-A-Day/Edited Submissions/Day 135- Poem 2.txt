Day 135- Poem 2



	Day 135- Poem 2 by ~a-random-quigle



The day opens like a gull
the world is new-
in the hazing of the morning
in the harbour without warning
bird boat shell
ring the ear like a church bell.

Six a.m. the food is stowed,
we pack maltesers and some aeros
we don&#146;t bring the apples, 
we slip supplies
rope, pot, spyglass 
everything except a thimble-
oh aren&#146;t we so quick and nimble
to dodge the scolding of their eyes?
The air is rough, the sand folds soft
beneath our toes,
every step is an adventure
as we skip to dodge the breaker foam.

The sun blooms like an anemone
the world is new-
an unchewed bone a polished stone
which we toss and we skip on the water
bird boat shell
ring the air like a church bell.
We play at pirate, we collect
moon snails and mussels,
we wander soaking in the glory,
every wave rings with a story.

And suddenly and sullenly
and sadly she wrinkles,
the world feels shadowed
curled periwinkled-
every story has an ending
and every game grows old.
Soon the sun is fleeing softly
and boredom gathers like a cloud,
home beckons with the warmth of a womb-
was this adventure worth the scolding,
we might have surfed the net at home...
