    The Art of Love

Love has left me wondering  
where I left my shoes and my socks  
and my bra  
and my trousers  
and my blouse – 

caught on the dresser  
riding the headboard  
snagged on the doorknob  
under the bed – 

over the rooftops  
away with the wind  
riding the river  
feeling it bend – 

snagging on lilypads  
playing with fish  
nibbling at bedrock  
making it itch –  
love has left me wondering.
