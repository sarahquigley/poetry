There this bloody fly which keeps twirling curling buzzin fizzing
about my room bedroom
landing on my furniture
soiling everything

oh but he must be dieing
the little thing is flying into everything
like he's on sedatives
and when he lands on my hand

his feet are very gentle
 

cicada nymph old man

woman of china girl with the fly as a pet

and then you touched my hand
