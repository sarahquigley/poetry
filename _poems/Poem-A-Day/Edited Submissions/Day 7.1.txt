Day 7.1



	Day 7.1 by ~a-random-quigle



Morning is dressing for tea with Mrs. Minchin-
pulling on apricot calico,
giggling girlishly.

She hobbles down the stairs,
flicks on the kettle,
takes currant buns and biscuits from their packaging,
sticks the toaster on,
sets the table with
butter and marmalade,
apricot jam,
she sighs-

Pity Afternoon, Evening
and Night couldn’t come-

Oh well.
