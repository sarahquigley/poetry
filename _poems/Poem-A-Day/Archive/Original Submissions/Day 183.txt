Day 183



	Day 183 by *a-random-quigle



My niece Katrina comes to visit
every Saturday at one thirty.
She&#039;s a nice girl, married to a Hungarian-
an engineer I think.
Every Saturday she brings me an apple
which only makes me think of our
backyard with the apple trees
and the damsons, the stone tossing
tadpole pond.

To see the mottles on the stone,
to feel the whittled bone,
makes me think of liver spots and wrinkles-
a nick for every passing day,
every small mistake
and eyebrow raised.
Conundrum!
A prison small a prison meek,
a prison large a prison bleak,
the wattles on the huts,
wild things carousing,
ties and stiff upper lip,
glass houses.

Mrs. Brown came to town
wearing her wrinkles and a crown,
Old Man Moss draped his beard,
a small adventure,
one small toad,
pick up pick up sticks
and stones.


Have you met my niece?
She comes on Saturdays
brings me garden apples
which makes me think of 
our old place we had apple trees
and damsons, a stone tossing
tadpole pond.

To see mottled stone,
to feel whittled bone,
makes me think of liver spots and wrinkles-
a mark for every passing day,
small mistakes
and eyebrows raised.
