January

my old bones
fallen branches
beneath new snow

February




March

shifting grass
the rain leaves
its own footsteps

April

a lawnmower
piles grass clippings
on the morning dew  

May

picnic on the hill
green grapes spilling
across the grass 

June

July

berry kisses
your skin tells tales
of heat and midges

August

beach ball
fruit fall
gulls call

September


glue will not
do for the trees  

October

dry leaves
flames raise them
to the sky again 

November

shallow graves
leaves buried
under leaves


December
