Day 69

Winter blues

If I could use
this brush 
to paint the sky
with sun
and smudge leaves 
on to the bare trees
I would.

(A few scantily clad ladies
Wouldn’t hurt either.)

But hell, I'm
not a god like I am
in my console game,
not the master of the brush.

I’ll mess around on paper,
paint pictures 
of sunny beaches
and girls in bikinis
and watch the rain
turn the ground
to muck.
