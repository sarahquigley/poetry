Day 140



	Day 140 by *a-random-quigle



I&#039;m bothered about something,
but I don&#039;t know why,
or what for that matter-
maybe it was all the cleaning,
a year&#039;s worth of moldy things
from the back of the fridge.

Sticky, grimy and stinking things,
you&#039;d be surprised the beasts
that lurk in the top of presses
and in the cracks 
beside the dishwasher-

and though you go at them
with brush and bottle,
they&#039;ve a tendency to rise again
unbidden, unbitten.

Maybe it was all the thinking,
cleaning is better than thinking-
so sleepless and at three am,
the house pristine,
I spill coffee on the carpet
just so I can do some scrubbing.

Maybe it was all the thinking,
cleaning is better than thinking,
though one is much like the other.
