Day 319



	Day 319 by *a-random-quigle


my mother's thick fingers
strong dry skin a little roughened
are assertive how she tames 

tugging fingers through tangles
she balls the gathered up
and tosses them out the bathroom window

I watch as a breeze sweeps them
down the Bride's Glen
where they catch on hooks of clover
