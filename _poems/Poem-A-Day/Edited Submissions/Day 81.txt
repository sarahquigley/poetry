Day 81



	Day 81 by *a-random-quigle



I

Sleepless, worried,
imagining lovers and car accidents,

in the half-light,
our cat is made only of darkness.

He unwinds himself
slithers to the bed,

I can feel him
burrowing beneath the bedclothes,
moving about my legs.



II

The night smells
of burnt tires,

twenty metres from the stop
the last bus whizzes by,

no taxi money.
