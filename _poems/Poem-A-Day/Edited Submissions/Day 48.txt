Day 48



	Day 48 by *a-random-quigle



cooling your toes
in the water
a small frog

hands mucky
from digging
and weeding

what a mess
the hosepipe hisses
to a stop

cooling your toes
in the garden
a small bog

spring bees

falling to ruin
our good work
dust in the sun

a small song
the hoovers hums
to rest

hands dry
from dusting
and cleaning

fear not
webs swept away 
flies around the bathroom bulb
