Day 363

Snake

Our road was a dark road,
a bed for night,
her mysterious forrests,
her studded waist,
beasts, ectasies.

Three Lithuanians worked
for three full weeks to erect
these travesties of manhood.

We may as well have pipped
her nipples out with a slingshot-
at least a star might have
landed in a backyard,
a few wishes been granted.

Night extinguished with a spine of lights,
the distance ahead clarifies
and I am afraid.
