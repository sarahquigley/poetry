
You showed me where to find crabs
and the right way to hold them
as they spit and nash their pincers
our pockets 

Was there anything before this?
Is there anything other than this?
I pick my way across the rocks in the darkness
by instinct
 I know the best rocks to flip for crabs
and how to hold them so all they can do is nash and spit
my pockets jangle with the empty shells
of periwinkles


Too easy to forget that this was
your childhood, not my own-
you that trundled home
spilling buckets of rock shrimp,
you that decorated this house with
waveworn flowers of coral,
you that placed that husk of a crab
on the windowsill
where it sits still, gathering dust. 





You watched the waves shudder in
rolling across the bay 
leaving the shore shudderring
with excitement.

You watched the waves toss sprats
on to the graveyard beached

the sprats toss themselves on to the graveyard beach
and tossed them back to sea
where they blossomed like rockets
and flickered out to sea.


You taught me where to find crabs
and the right way to hold them
which periwinkles were good to eat
the fastest way to move across the rocks



Carraroe 

The low walls, the rough scrubby land- 

the rock plants, orchids

gorse and heather, low - purple yellow
pricking your toes

those rocks covered in the tiny barnacles
so hard to walk on in your bare feet

Sean could navigate the rocks
between his house and the graveyard beach in the dark
he knew where they all were

periwinkles - the jewels of the coast
gathering the edible ones in a bucket to be sold at the factory

rotting seaweed down by the coast
where the farmers outlet their sewage

ponies and donkeys with poorly maintained hooves
needing to be shod

tossing beached sprats back into the sea

salt

the house, ridden with damp and salt and dust

gulls


I imagine your father
back bare stooped
his scalp browning
shifting rocks/ hefting rocks
one summer
he cleared a beach for you
the neighbours left fish
which crisped and sizzling
he served with lemon and parsley
and though a city boy
you knew every rock between keeraunmore / your feet knew every callous between keeraunmore
and the graveyard beach
where to find the biggest crabs
and how to hold them
as they nashed and spit
you filled your pockets with periwinkles
which you sold for pennies at the factory

Your childhood not mine-
So/Too easy to forget 
it was you that trundled home
spilling buckets of rock shrimp,
you decorated this house with
waveworn flowers of coral,
you placed that husk of a crab
on the windowsill


where it sits still, gathering dust.
