Day 237



	Day 237 by *a-random-quigle



Examine that sky doctor,
diagnosis, doctor?
A single growth.
Is it cancer? Is it a canker?

The night is dirty too,
mottled... moled.
Diagnosis doctor?
Is it cancer? Is it a canker?

The sun has been cut
from the sky. A neat excision.
The night has been swept
into the pan- dust banished-
cauterised.

That sterile sky is clean.
