On leaving

It's all a matter of how quickly
and how carefully

a dish on a counter
a strand on a pillow

a light in a window
a half eaten pear


a seed in the ground

a tree who, excepting the slight
of the sawman,
will outlive us 
and will never leave our door

a tree whose branches
so rugged and strong
stretch from the seashore
to the foot of a door
now barred and broken

My love, hear orchards whisper
When fruit burst from branches
remember mine on yours

the trees burst fruit

On returning

There by the window
a lion, saffron and mellow,
waits for the sun
to trip on the horizon
and slide into his jaws


On the end of time

There's no need to worry
There will be no worry
When there's nothing at all

I love

the silence of a silhouette
slipping across a half-lit wall
the taste of secret fruit
the old man who sells st. bridget's crosses
for pennies
the idea of a flea circus
the pulsations of dust in a ray of light
and the light 

On leaving


It's all a matter of how quickly
and how carefully -

a dish on a counter,
a strand on a pillow,
the dry stone of a plum -

a light in a window,
a half eaten pear, 
a seed in the ground -

a tree who, excepting the slight
of the sawman,
will outlive us 
and will never leave our door -

a tree whose branches,
so rugged and strong,
stretch from the seashore
to the foot of a door
now barred and broken -

My love, hear orchards whisper!
When fruit burst from branches,
remember mine on yours.
