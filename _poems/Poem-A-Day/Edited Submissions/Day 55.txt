Day 55

Poem 1

Sometimes I wonder if I could hide
in the folds of that tomato I ate
or that crepe from yesterday,
I’m small.

I’m small,
and I like to do small things
write silly poems that no one will read,
and draw pictures in the dust of my windowsill.

and I could disappear into the cracks of this lab,
being small and pipetting
and tapping hunched 
over the computer,

slowly and surely
forgetting
what’s it’s like
when the room can barely contain me.



Poem 2

passing plane
wasp sputtering
beneath the blind
