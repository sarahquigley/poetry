Day 13



	Day 13 by ~a-random-quigle



the lantern men sell their wares to those
who can find them-

plastic lighters, old mirrors, broken mobile phones,
chipped teapots

are their trade,

and of course lanterns-

of junk metal, old tin 

cans are born

lanterns in green, lanterns in red, lanterns of paper
and turnip and spun 

melongold 
lanterns cast from the sun
