Day 150

Poem 1

I might get a job with KPMG
or Price Waterhouse Cooper,
scratching and sniffing 
away at credits and debits,
balance sheets.

I&#039;ll get numbers up my nose,
under fingernails,
at the end of the week
crawling under the wire of my bra,
lice, serif jaws, itchy feet.

Like pepper, up my nose,
I&#039;ll sneeze all over the finances
of Hunter Lynch Associates,
leaving disarray,
numbers splattered everywhere.



Poem 2

Mrs. Maguire
is hobbling into Tesco,
her pull-case
clackety clacking
over the uneven payment.

She buys half a pint of milk
and wishes they packaged more things individually.



Poem 3

Little women pour from the bus,
their men are in the pub or dead perhaps-
one having much the same effect as the other.
Love was once a thing for the shadows of buses,
now it is gossip. They cling to each other
as they huddle in the bus stop,
their men are in the pub or dead perhaps
and they spend his pension
on a whirlwind trip with Golden Years.
