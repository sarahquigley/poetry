Day 128



	Day 128 by *a-random-quigle



Boy, reading Niedecker
and hiding behind your hair,
there among the scutch grass
and the dandelions-
I lie all day just where you lay,
oh love is a beast with wings,
she flies and she sings,
she wears gold rings
and drinks.

Oh the grass sticks
and I flick it away,
regret it later-
scents linger on my clothes 
for days,
and I imagine them spiced with you-
I dream of a soup of grass and you
to drink, 

I dream, but not even in that 
half world do I drink,
I taste and I spit
on the pavement,
beside the chewing gum
and the half-eaten mars bar,
love is a beast with wings,
she dies when she stings
and I&#146;ll have none of that.
