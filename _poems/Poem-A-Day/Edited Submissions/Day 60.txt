Day 60

Poem 1

City 8

The city is full
of soggy women-

their slick umbrellas
collide,

drops 
fly.



Poem 2

City 9

The city remembers
nothing,

it's full of holes!

Man holes, pot holes
skanky little drains
where the gunk goes,
where the drunks go-

I’ve fallen into
some of them

to awaken
shaken
in a moving street

and wonder how
I got there.

And where the time
has gone. 



Poem 3

Stepping stones

Burbling,
wise is the man
who puts his toes
before his feet.
