Day 46

Poem 1

A cat purrs
and uncurls from a windowsill,
her battered shadow hangs over the
street as she moves
a scar in the night’s 
supple streetlit skin,

a fox slips
around the orange of the streetlights,
the light can’t touch her slicksoft
curves
a wink in the night
slinking beautiful,

a crow pops
and drops.


They meet at binside,
talk of pigeons and sewerwine
and dine on the finest fermentations
of day old pizza,
week old microwave chicken pot pie.



Poem 2

- what are those apartments
there
lovely big balconies -

- I remember visiting Ballsbridge
Library as a child-

- the thing is
it's all Asians,
now if it was your ordinary
Joe-Soap
I'd -

- we were having our 
smoothies in Avoca -



Poem 3

two hopping birds
where's that worm
got it
