If it's going to snow
it will be in april
when 
my father will have taken his 

Lorine I want you take me down
to your home by the river
and show me all these things

that i don't understand

my mom was brought up in the city
my dad worked for years in the coddled wolrd of a university
of academia
what do I know of nature of the hard life

the people I admire giving me tour of your world

the sora's flight

and what I want to do for them
