a black bear turned polar  
night shot with light  
meander of a river  
belly of the moon  

tight bend of a cliff road  
promise of land beyond  
rusting head of a pickaxe  
tankard full of gold  

white finger tips  
lick the sea foam from my lips  
soft waves over heaving hips  
we are the lost ones  
washed ashore on islands  
of our bliss  

wrinkles carved on wrinkles
stories that they tell  
warmth of unfamiliar skin  
tattoos on calloused hands  

hanged god, summer’s end  
cracked shards of a porcelain bowl  
the kiss you’ll never know again  
the bells that never tolled
