Day 247



	Day 247 by *a-random-quigle



Wild to be welcomed by rich red folds,
to rest beneath meadows
leaves me drunk
without having drunk,
sends me flying
without setting seed.

---

I have ground you into the bowl
with my pestle-
you burst into curves,
soak the room in your rough ripe oils.

---

if the moon is a Rich Tea,
infuse me
in sea,
dissolve
a sugar cube
and dunk that moon-

if the sea is dark red tea
and I am spicy,
bring me the milk please
