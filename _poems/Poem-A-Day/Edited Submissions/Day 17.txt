Day 17



	Day 17 by ~a-random-quigle



Poem 1

Games

I

three small shoes sitting on the grass
four small feet wading in the stream
one small shoe bobbing on the water
sailing away on a grand
adventure

II

let’s play maidens and monsters
I’ll be the monster
I have bigger teeth

III

let’s run away
build a house in the old wood
from green umbrellas
(camouflage)
and live in it
forever

mom will never find us
there

IV

a toy carriage
carrying stuffed mice
and rabbits to tea
sits in the rain



Poem 2

jazz 
fruit salad
patchwork quilt

cut grass
fresh sass
sticking to our toes

a cart trips and trucks and trundles
along a knotted slip of a road
carrying oats and mice and more
to market

into the rocking sea
sinking soon
moon balloon

patchwork quilt
fruit salad
jazz
