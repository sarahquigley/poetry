Day 169

Poem 1

The streets are damson,
The streets are plum,
The streets run with
A thousand different flavours
Sticky, lick them from your fingers
Toes.

Little woman comes to town
Pulling her heart and wearing a frown,
She trades it at a country stall
For a dented pot and three wooden buttons



Poem 2

Night train

The clatter of hooves,
horses in the wild wild night
gallop by the window,
torches cast a wandering light,
castles rise and and castles fall.
