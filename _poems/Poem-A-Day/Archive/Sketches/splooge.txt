before I realised it mattered very little
I thought a lot of my intellect
but since it matters very little
there are others who can do the thinking
and I will sit and fish

before life/opened and closed to me
like a sunflower
and love left me sitting on the porch
watching the sunset over 

from rock and fern
scuttle dry black beetles

the morning sun polishes
the kiss of silvering slugs
this is the treasure
this is the juicy fruit

coal and diamonds
diamonds coal dust
merge and mingle
in the muck

keep your beaks sharp
dusty little miners


the miners sharpen their beaks


I ruffle my birdmother hood
of gentle feathers

I am a miner




In the California/Long Island desert/On long Island/In new York
Night are only noise/sound
Cicadas (click their heels) and distant warnings howls
Lone owls maraude
it is fine ,usic

four a.m. passes
eyes glaze
night is reduced to static

sticky
cicadas click unclick
howls distant warning owls
the crack of dawn

broken yolk
egg white
noise

if you stay up late enough
all that remains is noise







Turtle take me in with you
let's set up home together
in your hard shell
tape fluorescent flies
to the ceiling

Down in the blue lagoon
where anemones stroked their loverfish
dove a boy-
and down in the blue lagoon
where the octopi kissed
lived an oyster-
and it was love, oyster and boy,
boy oyster love.

Oh won't you let me inside
your fine white shell,
my beautiful one,
my pearlescant amour-
we'll set up home 
inside that cocoon,
there will be room enough for two,
for me for you my love-
said boy

but I've always wanted a kitchen
and a dining room,
a conservatory in the sun-
what about a lavatory my love-
and children?
Will there be room enough for three?
Will there be room enough for four?
You move so fast- said oyster to boy

My love there will be room enough,
my love there will be room enough
for me and for you,
for all the pearls
in the ocean,
for all the pearls
in the ocean,
their mother their father.


what more do we need?

for all the sand on the beaches

for all the sand on the beaches
and an ocean's worth of pearls.

I have followed the tracks of deer
through virgin land,
slept on dry moss
and catkins
beneath the boughs of a silver birch.

I have eaten fresh snow
from winter fields,
still whipped wattled with blades
of ryegrass
and flecked with white clover.

I have licked the wind
from the devil's mountain.

I have tasted the yellowed lace
of an older woman's collar,
caught her white neck
on my tongue,
an apparition.

I have marked foundations
and slung lines
for the borders of a new field,
only to fly home
leaving it unsown.


I have licked the wind
from the devil's mountain

I have followed the tracks of deer
through virgin land
and slept on dry moss

I have licked the wind

I have sung too few songs

I have not sung in a long time

Every morning my father shoots himself up on cafeine-
his drug, a thick black sludge
trawled from the bottom of a cafetiere.
Stern and silent,
he balances his cup on a radiator
and reads Feynman.

Over time you become a little like
your choice of beverage-
which is why my father smashed
the teeth of the daffodils
pushing from our muddied lawn,
and why I'll drink juice.

My Momma drives a station wagon
and Sundays she wears a suit
all square shoulders amd straight legs

My Mom drives a station wagon
she has dirty nails and broad feet
she's buxom and burly
and on Sundays she wears a suit to Mass


squinting for lights in the fog

the final temptations of fog
at midnight rain falls




Things that gather dust

window ledges
old friends
marriage

The full lips of a Bangledeshi child
brush my mango before it migrates
to my fruit basket
to join the kiwifruit from New Zealand
bananas

A sun-dried woman
strains for high fruit -
stalks break and green eggs tumble.

In some low hot market,
dust is raised by the hooves of bulls
and a swarthy hulk weighs green eggs in his hands,
brushes them against his fat lips.

He breathes deeply-
"A good mango should smell like a woman in heat,"
he says, tossing them aside.

5! :dance:

We arrive again with too many bags
for the long slog over hill,
we walk anyway, puffing fog into the chill air.
The house has that smell that they get
when they haven't been woken for a long while
of stale books and damp walls.

Old houses, like old people,
smell odd... like stale books,
This house is cranky, woken
to a smoking fire and cold
ripe wind sweeping across

Too easy to forget that this was
your childhood, not my own-
you that trundled home
spilling buckets of rock shrimp,
you that decorated this house with
waveworn flowers of coral,
you that placed that husk of a crab
on the windowsill
where it sits still, gathering dust.



Our road so long a haven for the stars
in this bright city
has been trespassed

Our road was a dark road,
a bed for night,
her mysterious forrests,
her studded waist,
beasts, ectasies.

Three Lithuanians worked
for three full weeks to erect
these travesties of manhood.

We may as well have pipped
her nipples out with a slingshot
at least a star might have
landed in a backyard,
a few wishes been granted.

Night extinguished with a spine of lights,
the distance ahead clarifies
fearfully.

I'd rather wonder at the sky above
then see the road ahead.


Whale Concert
Maze, Fin, Goose, Droplet
Singing in the Echo Mountains
There will never be another one like it




is Silver the only one awake
in the warren?

a starless night
owls prowl and foxes
wow-o-wow-o-wow
across the fields

her sister's dream
of spring
fields fresh with
grass and clover

Silver thinks of snow

 

If I had time I would catch eels for you
and just any eels
I would take a rocket to the sun
and when I 

I wonder if 
and feed you sunlight for the day ahead
eggs
you all of you that I love
to freshen you

Every morning
a man tosses a coin in the fountain-
he wishes his wife would stop nagging him
about the fig tree his father planted
and for his son to fall in love with rich women.
Plop!

Every afternoon
a small girl tosses a coin in the fountain.
Plop!
She likes that noise.
