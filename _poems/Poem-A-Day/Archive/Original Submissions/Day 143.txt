Day 143

Poem 1

That was the house with the umbrellas-
and there, fwoosh opening,
I saw a child in a red dress,
wild kid,
she was a girl 
of course.



Poem 2

The roofs are bumpy bumpy
grooved,
perfect for stone rolling,
wildly to skitter-
a pleasant pip pip pip
until plop
off into the water.



Poem 3

These balconies must
have been the work of spiders,
so finely spun,

cobweb on web,
the work of giant spiders
build a roost for spiders small.
