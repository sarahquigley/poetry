Day 107



	Day 107 by *a-random-quigle



While you were away,
I rearranged the larder twice,
I ironed my lingerie,
I changed the bedclothes
so your return would be crisp,
punctuated with cotton.

It&#146;s midnight now
and you set me trembling,
your snores punctuate the couch-
I can find my own enjoyment
among the untouched folds
of our bedclothes.
