if this wilderness is to be our garden
then it will need to be weeded once in a while

relationship love garden 

wilderness - wild beasts

relationship garden to be tended

talk about my parents purchasing the house
planning building


wilderness desirable spark in relationship
wildbeasts rove

my grandmother was a wise woman
if you do not tend it it will not grow

the grass was two feet high
they planted peonies
and used scythes
borrowed horses from the tinkers down the old lane

against the advice of the architect
they left the ash trees
in the front yard
which now in winter fill the troughs of the gutters 
with old leaves

a wilderness but theirs
to explore and tame

barrow ash and clay
the beginning of the day
the dawn of the day
cleared/wheeled/filled by hand 
brought sweat 
in the heat of the day

it was rough/they were rough times
even the love making
tumultous


the grass climbed two feet high
they planted peonies
and used rusty scythes
borrowed horses from the travellers down the lane

against the advice of the architect
they left the ash trees
which in winter filled 
the troughs of the gutters with leaves

a wilderness but theirs
barrow, ash/sand and clay
the beginning of the day
cleared, filled, wheeled by hand 
brought sweat 
in the heat of the day

it was rough/they were rough times
but the days passed quickly
tumultous
