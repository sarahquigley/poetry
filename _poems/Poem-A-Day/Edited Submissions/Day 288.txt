Day 288



	Day 288 by *a-random-quigle



Those still chill winter mornings
when the sky is a blazing 
unblemished blue,
like it&#039;s been swept clean
by a night of hard fast rain.
These mornings could be mistaken for warm
if, while driving to work
down the Stonebridge Road,
you weren&#039;t blinded
by the low sweep of the sun
and the ground didn&#039;t sparkle
quite so intensely with hoarfrost.
