Day 158

Poem 1

have you ever watched
the beetle crawl
over leaf and stone?

i chew my pencil
and try to trace
the paths of feet-

beetle etchings
starling scratchings
snail shine,

they meet and part
they&#146;d love to talk
some other time.

lives knot
inside of flowers
darkside of leaves-



Poem 2

it&#146;s cold at night
the same old cold
gets into my toes
and stays there

it&#146;s cold at night
but i&#146;m used to that now
i gather my toes
in my fingers and squeeze

i wrap my hands
around my feet
and rub rub rub
until they&#146;re red and raw

a woman of my age
takes care of
her own needs



Poem 3

there are three birds
standing by the window
day after day-
they stay through summer
through winter too-
they do not eat the seed
we leave-
they sit and grunt
and twitch and heave-
their beaks move across
the skyline



Poem 4

dad built a cabinet
took him a week
screwed it together
admired his work

screwed it apart
and varnished each piece
forgot all about them
we&#146;re chopping them up

for firewood
