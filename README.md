Poetry, and code.

View live version: [Read my poetry.](http://sarahquigley.github.io/poetry/)

## What is this project?

I enjoy writing poetry. This project creates a simple website where my poetry is displayed.

## Any features worth noting?

### Simple design

The ultra-simple look of the website was designed to keep the focus of the visitor on the poetry itself.

### Responsive design

The website's design is totally responsive. The site is just as beautiful (and easy to read) on mobile, tablet or desktop.

## What tools did you use to create this project? 

### Jekyll static site generator and hosting with Github Pages

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), an excellent static site generator and the engine behind [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), makes it really simple to create a ready-to-publish static site. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) provides simple and free hosting for Jekyll sites. These are my go-to tools for web-based personal projects.

### Google WebFonts

[Google Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) is an excellent resoource for creating beautiful online typography.

### Font Awesome Icons

[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is my go to icon font for use online.

## Did you create the design for the website?

Yes, the design is my own, with some inspiration taken from here and there around the web.

## Why did you make this?

I wanted a simple and elegant way to publicly display my poetry portfolio.

## Supported browsers 

Chrome, Firefox 5+, IE 10+, Opera 12+, Safari 4.0+.
