Day 7.2



	Day 7.2 by ~a-random-quigle



I

Morning is dressing for tea with Mrs. Minchin-
pulling on apricot calico,
giggling girlishly.

She hobbles down the stairs,
flicks on the kettle,
takes currant buns and biscuits from their packaging,
sticks the toaster on,
sets the table with,
butter and marmalade,
apricot jam,
she sighs-

Pity Afternoon, Evening
and Night couldn’t come-

Oh well.

II

Afternoon is playing bowls with Mr. Maguire in the park-
the first few days of spring are fresh and cold
and the birds are singing their
first few songs of love.

He thinks of Mrs. Minchin,
how her supple figure had once lit the streets on fire,
he sighs-

and bowls another ball.

III

Evening is having a gossip with Molly the Cat-
uncurling from old worn armchairs,
they touch noses over the fire,

Whisper about the thrill of the hunt,
ogle over the handsome stray
living in Mrs. Minchin’s garbage cans,
tut at the star-studded collar Fat Fidelma’s
been flaunting,

They lick each other’s paws,
hold each other tight until
wispily Evening retreats up the chimney.

IV

Night is dancing alone
in a silver forest,
while Mrs. Minchin watches
Coronation Street alone,
while Mr. Maguire sits alone drinking
ale in The Old Swan,
while Molly the Cat stalks
the night alone.
