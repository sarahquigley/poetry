Maybe one day I'll have a wikipedia page
which ten thousand hits a day
which talks about my accomplishments
and what a great person I happen to be
and folks all over the internet
will read about my history
how my dad 

But until that glorious day
I'll have to be content with a myspace page
where I can network with my friends


which simplifies my history
down to a few stuttering/beautiful paragraph

which speckles my accomplishments
with a million blue hyperlinks 

and folks all pver the internet
will click on all the hyperlinks
that speckle/bejewel/decorate my accomplishments
like blue jewels in a cloudy sky

but until that happy day
I'll decorate my myspace page
with dancing penguins and quizzes that deduce from a few arbritrary questions saying I kiss like certain characters from saved by the bell
then when I mature a little
I'll

Maybe one day I'll have a wikipedia page / there will be a wikipedia entry all about me
that gets a thousand hits a day
that simplifies my history
down to a few beautiful paragraphs
and folks all over the internet
will click on all the hyperlinks
that speckle/bejewel/decorate my accomplishments
like blue jewels in a cloudy sky

but until that happy day
I'll decorate my myspace page
with dancing penguins and cute bunnies
and quizzes that deduce from a few arbritrary questions 
that I kiss like czak from saved by the bell

one day I'll get tired of that/ of networking with my friends
but by that time I'll have wikipedia page
that gets a thousand hits a day
that simplifies my history
down to a few beautiful paragraphs
and when I'm feeling self-indulgent
I'll press that little edit button
and add few pertinent facts about my life and times
and then a few days later
some bastard invigilator will take them down
