Day 332



	Day 332 by *a-random-quigle



I'll wear my paper coat
I'll sail a paper boat

the further I'll sail the damper 
the more there'll be to bail

my boat will have had its day
and my coat will melt clean away

and I'll float like driftwood
until I snag the shore

where mangroves will smother me
in their roots 

where I will disguise my nudity / innocence
with big (fig) leaves
