Day 198



	Day 198 by *a-random-quigle



"second to the right and straight on &#039;til morning"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J. M. Barrie, Peter Pan

My mother opened the door,
looked down the long winding road
and shivered-

down the long road,
down the long road, down the long road
lurk fortunes read
in paperclips.

My mother opened the door,
looked to the open sky
and pointed-

There, Sarah, is a star-
chase it, chase but don&#039;t trip
or twist and turn, the pursuer pursued,
the course is straight and airborne-

and though odd little stares will seek to string you up
or beat you down,
fly.

Someone please buy me a self-help book-
Flying for Dumbies or whatever, 
book me an appointment with a bird-
I would rather be a lost kite than an old shoe.
