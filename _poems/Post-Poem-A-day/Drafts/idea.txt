The monkey and the man fought like dogs
The monkey and tore at each other's throats
We watched them move in circles
tracing each others's steps
the blows they moved in spirals
right right right left
oh it was terrible
oh it was cruel
but you couldn't help but watch
saliva slip from broken mouths
and mix with blood and earth

oh what a potion
the witches cry is heard
and in the commotion she sweeps down
from the sky
the crowds they squawk like jackdaws
and stone her with their words
oh it was terrible
oh it was cruel
but you couldn't help but watch
saliva slip from cracked mouths
and mix with blood and earth

the blood that stained the soil
made rorschach of the ground
i've always thought that violence/bad intent
was hidden in those mouths

But timid queen, the bard said,
I haven't won you yet

The first snow

Umber was a parched land.The ground pealed like old paint
 as did the people. Twice a year the people of Umber changed their skin.
The festival began with the beating of the Umbdrum. And as the drum
beating rose to a cresendo the crowd would begin to bleat and beat their chests.
From a slab in the centre of the Umb, the priestess would rise from, her whithered
hair surrounding her in whithered halo. 

And then all the people sloughed their skin. And from beneath their dry leathery hides
white skin would emerge and glow in the light of the sun.

The gournd was cracked and worn like old parchment.
