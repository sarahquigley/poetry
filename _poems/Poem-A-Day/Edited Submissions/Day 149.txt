a screwdriver the man is handy
the man is handy with
the dog the man is handy
the man is handy with
a knife and fork the man is handy
the man is handy with
the lawnmower the man is handy

a spanner the man is handy
the man is handy with
the internet the man is handy

Poem 2

Takako Minekawa sings Recubed
and we are recubed,
our temporary life is a shrinking view
through a porthole.



Poem 3

I go out at night
and search the underside of leaves,
expecting to find them fattening
among the slugs and snails-
wet and silver, answers nibbling
at the moonlight.

Sometimes I search
the slim volumes on my shelf,
Niedecker and Barrie.
Time is white, it is the nightly custom
of every good mother
after her children are asleep
to rummage in their minds,
I walk the house 
peering into vacant bedrooms,
time is white,
and this flamingo has no lagoons
flying over her.

I rush out in the mornings
to gather some from the joints
of spider webs,
quickly quickly, before the sun
dries them up and away.
I drink a cup down,
pour the rest into a plastic box
and stick it in the freezer.



Poem 4

Dad made me a puzzle toy,
Dad made me a puzzle toy,
he sat all night by the fire
fiddling with a wire coat hanger.
My Dad is strong,
he couldn&#039;t find the pliers,
he used his bare fingers!
A heart on a trapeze,
it swings when I sneeze!
I asked him how to solve it,
he told me I should think about it.



Poem 5

Monica awakes uncreased,
makeup unsmeared, 
quite refreshed.
In bed at four a.m.
awake at seven thirty,
dancing all night,
but neither wine nor party weary,
while I am crusty eyed
and bleary.
