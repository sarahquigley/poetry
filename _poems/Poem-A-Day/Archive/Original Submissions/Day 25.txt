Day 25



	Day 25 by ~a-random-quigle



Poem 1

rain haiku

headphones blaring
a new rhythm
shaking the train



Poem 2

Basketball song

let’s play-
even if it’s raining,
even if the night's coming

let’s play-
even if the backboard's rotting,
even if the court is crumbling

let’s play-
even if the basket’s hanging
from its last screw

let’s play-
even if your boyfriend’s a jerk
and you want to die

let’s play-
even if your boss has fired you
and your cat’s conspired to kill 
your bloody goldfish

let’s play-
even if the Swedes are invading New Hampshire
and aliens are bombing New York State

let’s play-
even if Ireland
(after some nasty nuclear fallout)
has been turned into a nature reserve
for fifty thousand years

let’s play-
even if the world’s bending into outer space
due to a massive gravitational shift
in the space time continuum,
even if the world’s ending
let’s listen to the rhythm of the ball
and

today,
if only for today,
let’s play



Poem 3

as I listen to some other guy’s music on the train

pink sunglasses
Shagaboom
elaborate nails
Boom shagaboom
twiddling with her curls
Boom shagaboom

a dozen boats
Shagaboom
floating colours
Boom shagaboom
far out on the bay
Boom shagaboom

yellow houses
Shagaboom
birds like louses
Boom shagaboom
crawl the hairy cliffs
Boom shagaboom

lovers and ice-creams
Shagaboom
a Labrador dog
Boom shagaboom
lolloping across the beach
Babadeewop Shagaboombam
