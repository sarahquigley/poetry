Otter&#039;s first love

Otter&#039;s first love was not
a rough wave,
strong fingers-
not the shrill call
of gulls,
moving against the cliffs-
not the smooth movement
of oyster and stone
in paw, and cracking-

floating on his back,
he watched the boats
come in to land-
might he hoist a bright sail
from his belly too?
