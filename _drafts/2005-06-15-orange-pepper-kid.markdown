   Orange Pepper Kid 
---

Beneath the scent  
of orange peel leaves  
we creep like kittens  
rippling the quilt.  

Someone said  
that Alexander smelled  
this sweet,  
flower petal boy  
and god that he was.  

When they dipped Achilles  
in the river Styx  
did he come out  
smelling like water,  
sharp and cool  
beneath the nose?  

Well, they must have dunked you  
in sugary tea then,  
doused you  
with citrus pepper  
and clove oil.
