Day 282



	Day 282 by *a-random-quigle



My life on paper is rakish,
tight as a papoose,
rolling like beads across the pages,
fractals from seed to weed - it is wild.

It is the moon and her shadows
and all the love that has been dried
on her soft white hands,
scabbing them over, pocking them.

I have built myself a house-
it is enormous and unfinished, it is the deer,
it is the oak tree, it is the sea,
I will sit in the kitchen

and make a pot of tea.
