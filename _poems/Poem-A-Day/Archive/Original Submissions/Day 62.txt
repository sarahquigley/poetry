Poem 2

Man using Mac OS X

It's sexy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that rabid shuffling
of windows, of code,

your trackpad caress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slow
deliberate,

when you hit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the keys you pound
pound pound.



Poem 3

An excitement
of crumbs, of fossil tissues
of pizza boxes,

an archaeologist
would sift your stories.

But you,
what do you sift 
from your half-old junk,

memories,
or do you read your future

in the mottles 
of those dirty dry dishes
of the moldy tea?

Purge
no future no past,
nothing left to gather germs
or dust.
