Day 91



	Day 91 by *a-random-quigle



Headphones

A man whistles tunelessly,
birds squawk love to the sky,
a dog yaps at a passing fly,
teens jabber about nothing
at all,
a rich quilt to get tied up,
the streets are stitched with
fearful noise.

And so,
let&#146;s build walls,
stuff our ears with cha
oomcha oom,
what was it some twat said about a tree
falling in the forrest?
It&#146;s as if it never happened
at all-

but oh, what are we missing,
deaf to the passing of the day?
