Day 261



	Day 261 by *a-random-quigle



I only believe in God during the night-
there&#039;s something about that insanity of stars
that requires it of me.
I think God took scissors to the sun and made confetti,
and every night became a wild party-
and that made it okay for every day to be a cold white trudge.
I think God took a scissors to the sun.

The only problem seems to be that moon:
when all the stars were cut, how did God find enough for that?
I&#039;ve listened to a lot of songs about the moon,
but they&#039;ve answered nothing really-
my moon is a pregnant belly, button distended to a crater-
my moon is a white head, soft haired and wispy,
slipping from a black womb.

Sometimes I hold my belly and ask -
is this all I am, a machine? And then I get annoyed
because you can&#039;t get far enough away
in this country... every mile beaded with houses,
farmland stitched to city. I could climb Carrauntohill,
but even from there I could count beads-
and besides it makes me think of Oedipus.

Sometimes I think I&#039;m not nearly miserable enough
or too miserable perhaps-
why the fuck does the sky have to be this clean?
Give me something to moan about please!
Why the fuck does dinner have to smell this good
and each day have to wind its way so casually into the next?
Can&#039;t somebody die please?

Sometimes I walk down to Killiney beach
and imagine these questions skipping off the glassy sea,
it&#039;s at those times that I miss Google
and the Wikipedia-
though the internet isn&#039;t a solution,
not really-
it&#039;s just an easier way to drown.
