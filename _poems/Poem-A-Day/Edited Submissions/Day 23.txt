Day 23



	Day 23 by ~a-random-quigle



Home-
it’s hot and late and I feel old.
I pull off my tie, slump into a chair,
poke about for sandals 
and a cigarette.

Down the stairs
a dusty laugh careens,
settles for an instant on the windowsill,
only to swirl like a ghost out the window- suddenly
all I want is to sit on benches by the canal
like we used too,
your voice, rough like broken crockery,
carrying my off-tune whine above the city din
and your laughter-


that laughter is the shadow of a cloud
carrying rain elsewhere.
