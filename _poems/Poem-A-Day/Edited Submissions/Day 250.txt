Day 250

November butterflies

November has lost her rain,
crisp the leaves remain
and wings the leaves retain-
November butterflies.

Hardened up,
won&#039;t suck me up
and down through merging
muck and leaves.

The November butterfly
circles halogens-
a mistake to awaken now
when frost is the coming flower.

November&#039;s gained no glue,
my boots are free to move
through freely flying,
freely dying leaves.
