Poem 1

Attractive word combinations

The autumn guard.
Lilypad diaries.
One blue sock.
Fiddle fox.
Fragile gloves.


Poem 2

Momma found my other glove
it wasn&#039;t on the floor
she screamed and huffed and rioted

Momma found my other glove
stretched over his claw
grizzled bear and paw.


Poem 3

Giraffe&#039;s long neck&#039;s not up to much
when galaxy&#039;s the food,
she wants to eat the Milky Way-
she&#039;s heard it&#039;s sweet and good.
