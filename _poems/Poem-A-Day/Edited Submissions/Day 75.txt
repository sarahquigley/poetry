Day 75

Buy me
white lingerie

let it cling
to my clean
curved flesh.

Buy me
white lingerie

I love lace
it brings snow
on sunny days

and snow
on any day
is beautiful.

The air is sticky
with sawdust
it clings to nose hair
and brings on fits of sneezes

and there’s Frank
at his bench
sawing and thinking
it’ll be a liquor cabinet

one of these days
if I can just figure out
where I left
the paint.

---

Let’s leave that
beautiful diecast cannon
in the shop -

if the little people
that live beneath
the floorboards,

in our shoes,
have wars
there’s no need

to arm them.

Porn magazine

God
she looks so good
through that clear plastic packaging

grip and tug
and rip
go at her with teeth

she looks that delicious she’s worth it.

---

Jo was out in the garden
smoking a cigarette
and weeding.

Mr. Merriman died
at three forty five
on a Tuesday afternoon
taking in the bins.

Frank McNamara
slipped on.

Mr. Murphy’s wife
had just made him
a fry and a cup of coffee
on a full stomach
lucky guy.

Susan didn’t hear
the van coming. 

---

The metal railings
hide small
tears in their joints

dripping the morning
slips onwards
into gutters

and away.

---

I like tunnels,
they're a place
for slipping
secrets.

---

You move like
a train,
too steady
chug chug
no stop,

years pass -
a station so sudden
a stop and drop
your burdens,

take this moment
to look at your
surroundings,

skies - a bird
hopping between trees,
kids chasing
lovers with suitcases,

oh, what you've been missing.

---

Pa joked
that the world
was black and white
in his day

we're spoilt
he says,
our clothes are 
bright
moving rainbows.

---

Follow the silver
line out
to the east,

the tracks smooth
between slips of brush
and birds hop

and peck
between the hidden
sleepers -
they end abruptly

walk on -
there's a cliff 
and an old house,

at the foot
of these ruined walls
you were dreamed up

little one.

---

I am a gentle weaver
of sound,
I wear bangles on my ankles
tie bells to my shoelaces.

I am a gentle weaver
of words,
I wear adjectives on my ankles
tie nouns to my shoelaces

clink.

---

Thoughts of a giant sentient robot

The towers are shiny
like tasty stuff
like apples
I want to eat them
chomp.

---

While the sun bathes
in the great blue,
the trees are green
gold silver bark
celebrations,

but when she sleeps
they gnash -
they have big teeth you see
and fingers to slip,
to shiver at skin.

---

Your open mouthed
stare
and that constant 
look of O My Lord
freaks me out

I should be the one
staring

is it so unusual
to kiss
to talk of love?

---

It's okay
not to be fascinating
everyday -

we all drink tea
pair socks
talk about the shopping
or the kids,

Sarah got an A on her maths test,

Jason drew a picture of an octopus,
it's on the fridge -
go see.

---

The kid was
an elaborate twirling
affair

pinwheel
he bumped into strollers

sang his own song.

---

I am a man

I am a hill
I grow hair
I shave once 
in a while

---

I am me

I live and breathe
and sleep and sneeze
precisely as I please

---

Put down that pen
it's dangerous
kid.

---

umbrellas
the sand seems
to flower
beach ball
fruit fall
gulls call

---

Roar
i am a pot of soup,
i am bubbling
over
you cannot contain me,
i can turn down the heat,
please don't do that.
