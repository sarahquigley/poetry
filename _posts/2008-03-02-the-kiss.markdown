    The Kiss

I have followed the tracks of deer  
through virgin land,   
slept on dry moss  
and catkins  
beneath the boughs of a silver birch.

I have eaten fresh snow  
from winter fields,   
still whipped wattled with blades  
of ryegrass  
and flecked with white clover.

I have licked the wind  
from the devil's mountain.

I have tasted the yellowed lace  
of an older woman's collar,   
caught her white neck  
on my tongue,   
an apparition.

I have marked foundations  
and slung lines  
for the borders of a new field,   
only to fly home  
leaving it unsown.
