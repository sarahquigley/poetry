Day 99

Poem 1

traffic jams wear tuxedos these days

these newfangled cars
have coats
tailed and winged
and oh man they would be beautiful
if they didn&#146;t creep so slow



Poem 2

Margery,
meet my friend Maximillian Beetle.
He has three yellow spots and one blue,
he likes honey in his camomile tea,
he lives in my shoe,
and oh, he is invisible...
but then, of course, so are you.
