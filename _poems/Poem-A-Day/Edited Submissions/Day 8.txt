Day 8



	Day 8 by ~a-random-quigle



I left the village of Sadness (Lost and Found)
and crossed the billowing Shoelace Plains
until I reached the cotton turrets of
Pantaloon Castle.
There, they say, the king holds court
on a trouser throne
and the queen drinks underwear tea for breakfast.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Sir Knight, only you.”

I travelled day, I travelled night,
across the valley where the shirtghosts flit,
past the googly-eyed buttonmen,
through the darkness of the Unpaired Forest.
There umbrellatrees with socks for leaves 
dance and squawk with shoebirds,
stiletto beaked and cruel.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Mista’ Knight, only you.”

I travelled day, I travelled night,
(until there yawned the funeralsilk lair)
(until there yawned a terrible site
the paisley teeth of the blacksilk lair
of the terrible tartan coatmonster)
until I came to the funeralsilk lair
of the terrible tartan coatmonster.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked
“No,” he growled “but I’d sure like to,
she sounds deee-licious.”
(I'd like to pick her hangers clean
I'd like to rummage in her drawers)
("No" he roared "but if I did 
I'd rummage in her dresser
I'd pounce on her/ catch her/ eat her/ I'd tear apart/open/ slice open her closet doors
and pick her hangers clean")
Then I slew the beast
and I travelled home
to my hut in the village of Sadness

where I tore apart your drawers,
picked every hanger clean,
where I folded your castles, your forests
and your beasts
away 
in black plastic bin-liners.

and there I 
you were lost and I was found

where I folded castles ghosts and beasts
into the attic drawers / a chest of drawers
still my heart
folded in my chest
beat not
for a love that's lost


and there I found a chest of drawers
where folded need and clean

I packed away castels ghots and beast
and unpacked the folded ventricles
of slightly broken heart
and put it back inside my chest

I travelled day, I travelled night,
until there yawned a terrible site
the paisley teeth of the blacksilk lair / the gaping jaws of the damask lair  bombazine argyle chevron pinstripe
of the terrible tartan coatmonster.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked
“No,” he growled “but I’d sure like to,
she sounds deee-licious.”
"No" he roared "but if I did 
I'd pick her hangers clean!"

[Incensed I brandished scabbard
he gnashed his paisley teeth
I ducked and dodged and dive
and with a single sweep
I cut/sliced right of his coat tails
and then I slew the beast]

“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Mista’ Knight, only you.” the birds replied,
and the trees shook like a hundred washing lines.

he swung his chevron claws.
he unravelled warp to weft.

unravelled at my feet,
torn warp from weft
he lay in tatters at my feet
and moaned a final groansome moan
for it was my fair maiden's coat that I had drawn and slaughtered

“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked,
“No, Mista’ Knight, only you.”

I travelled day, I travelled night,
until there yawned a terrible sight
the gingham jaws of the silken lair
of the terrible tartan coatmonster.
“Have you seen a maiden, fair and true?” I asked
“No,” he growled “but I’d sure like to,
she sounds deee-licious.”
"No" he roared "but if I did 
I'd pick her hangers clean!"

Incensed, I brandished scabbard -
he drew a chevron claw,
he gnashed his paisley teeth,
but I was quicker to the mark
and with a single sweep,
I sliced right off his coat tails
and then I slew the beast...

I slew the beast and travelled home
to my hut in the village of Lost and Found.

my maiden neither found nor won

no gold, no rough rewards
came raining from the sky

no gold no rough rewards
came rainging from the sky
no lady love emerged
from that the dragon's eye.

and at my feet the beast
unravelled warp from weft he lay
tattered at my feet

unravelled warp from weft,
tattered at my feet,
he moaned a final loansome moan
and with that groan, I wept

love neither lost nor won,
only recollection found,
a trail of tatters torn I left
as I travelled home / to follow me home
to my hut in the village of Lost or Found

no gold, no rough rewards



unravelled warp from weft,
tattered at my feet he lay,
unravelled warp from weft,
he moaned a final moan
and I wept
he moaned a final loansome moan

and moaned a final lonesome moan.
I turned away and wept
