My life on paper is rakish,  
tight as a papoose –    
rolling like beads across the page,  
fractals from seed to weed - it runs wild.

I have known the moon and her shadows,  
felt the love that has dried   
on her soft white hands,  
scabbing them over, pocking them.  

I have built myself a house –   
it is enormous and unfinished, it is the deer,  
it is the oak tree, it is the sea –   
I will sit in the kitchen  

and make a pot of tea.
