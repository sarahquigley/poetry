Day 346



	Day 346 by *a-random-quigle

At eleven p.m. Eastern Standard Time
a phone call. "Ma's dead, heart attack."
For an instance, the dust froze in the air.

Numb I washed towers of dishes, booked
flights and dozed, my head wet wool.

The airport fizzed with the laughter
of holidaygoers- and I'm a fish
in a bottle of coke, breathing poison
bubbles.
