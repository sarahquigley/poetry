Day 99

Poem 1

traffic jams wear tuxedos these days

these newfangled cars
have coats
tailed and winged
and oh man they would be beautiful
if they didn&#146;t creep so slow





Poem 2

Margery,
meet my friend Maximillian Beetle.
He has three yellow spots and one blue,
he likes honey in his camomile tea,
he lives in my shoe,
and oh, he is invisible...
but then, of course, so are you.


(Optional second verse)

Maximillian,
meet my friend Margery Mouse,
She has white fur and a wiggly nose,
she lives inside a jam pot / in the pocket of my coat / in my coat pocket,
she likes to nibble on my toes 
and oh, she is invisible...
but then, of course, so are you!
She likes to bathe in cheese fondue
