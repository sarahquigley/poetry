   Grandma's 
   Wild Lace 
---

For the little ones  
Grandma grew lace  
in her backyard,  
twining like ivy  
up the willows   
and the sycamores,  
a spider's snowfall.  

Stopping to smooth  
the curtains from our eyes,  
she flicked the sun in  
through the fly screens.  

We never noticed the dusk  
because the house still smelled  
of melons and bagels  
and matzo ball soup.
