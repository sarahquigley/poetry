Day 306



	Day 306 by *a-random-quigle



I live by the ocean
and every night the waves
arch and fall.

And every night as the waves
breath heavily
I count leaves
and the broken stalks
of seaweed
travelling to sea.

I count the rusty silhouettes
of cans and consolations
they make constellations
scrabbling for land
crab. 

I live by the ocean
and every night the waves
tidy up
untidy.
Only when the tide has fallen,
limp, can I sleep.
