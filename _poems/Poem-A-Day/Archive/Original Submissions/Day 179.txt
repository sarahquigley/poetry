Day 179



	Day 179 by *a-random-quigle



The best way to save your lettuce
from the slugs
is to dig a little tub of beer into the earth
and let them drown themselves-

A blissful drunken oblivion,
no more of that midnight hunt,
flashlights out, picking slugs
from the underside of leaves.

A fine way to catch flies
is to leave the jam open,
or the honey,
thin wings stick-

They buzz for a little while,
until finally they fizzle out,
sit and die little
by little.

Come to think of it,
that might be the best way to catch men-
beer and honey.
