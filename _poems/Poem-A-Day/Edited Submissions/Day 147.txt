Day 147

Poem 1

Sunday in the Forrest Cafe,
I give all the stranger
names and stories
and secrets.

The guy in the pink apron and the flowered shirt
is Karoly from Bulgaria,
his parents are wealthy expats,
owned a yacht and sailed the Mediterranean.
In a fit of boredom,
Karoly left them and became
plain old Charlie, waiter,
part-time bohemian.

The chubby girl in the long green dress,
nose-pierced, bustling between tables,
is Margery,
a vegan hippie chick with an obsessive streak.
She (secretly) has a thing about swiss cheese,
she fiddles with her food when she eats,
makes faces with her peas,
landscapes from the mashed potatoes.
She dreams of girls at night.

The delectable woman in the zebra stiletos
and the cream alpaca shawl,
cradling her little one,
is Tatyana, a Russian cliche.
She was a spy&nbsp;&nbsp;for the KGB and a fashionista
before, in a single night passion,
she was seduced by a British dentist (of all things),
who ensured there was one in the oven
and always plenty ready for the baking.

And then there&#039;s giantman,
he doesn&#039;t need a name.
He was once a prize fighter
(three times World Heavy Weight Champion)
(and a hired thug).
He found God and a girl,
gave it all up to be a gardener
(specialty ferns and mosses)
and a superhero of the night.

Our eyes meet, the girl
in the highnecked shirt and I,
her with her sketchpad,
I with my spiral,
quietly making each other&#039;s stories.

The girl in the highnecked shirt
is Lena, she drinks peppermint tea
from a camomile cup.
She collects eclectic hats,
she has a fear of beetles,
a delicate almost Japanese
sense of the aesthetic.
Her parents died in a tragic accident
of some kind or another I&#039;m sure,
and her eyes, her eyes are filled
with the most delicious kind of sadness.


Poem 2

Another birthday over,
birthday among birthdays.
I don&#039;t think anything-
not very much anyway,
not very much anymore.
I watch them clear
the wine bottles,
pouring the leftovers
into a pitcher,
mixing 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon
and 2005 Riesling
with the 1967 Pinot Noir 
Don&#039;t mix the white and red!
(Don&#039;t mix the old and the young.)



Poem 3

Crab

If I lift you up between my thumb and forefinger,
you&#039;ll gnash your little claws and spit.
I will study your hard curves
and find answers.
I need to build myself a suit like yours,
I too might be brave enough
to gnash and spit.
