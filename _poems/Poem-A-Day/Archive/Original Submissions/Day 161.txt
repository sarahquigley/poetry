Day 161



	Day 161 by *a-random-quigle



The day a wave
rode up to the house,
we watched, 
from the safety of the second story,
our shoes hitch from the doorstep
and mount-

and off they trotted,
bobbing downup,
bodyless riders
off off off
tossed to a gallop.

The wind was strong
drawing the line and firing-
my bra took down a seagull
in a swift shot,
your skirt just missed a cormorant-
dressed the waves in paisley.

A tide of wildbeasts
with wild feet,
a herd of paisley swept,
taking our television
and our kitchen utensils,
saddling the walls and windows
to the small of their backs-
little ships,
leaving us standing stripped
naked in the ripening wind.
