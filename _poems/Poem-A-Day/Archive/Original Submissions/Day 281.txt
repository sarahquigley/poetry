Day 281



	Day 281 by *a-random-quigle



The snowflake
is cast from water
to give a wheel of lace-

all children know this.
Father Frost fastens
his wheels to the carriage
of the Ice Queen,
but that is not the secret.

The secret of snow
is sloughed from the skin
of albino serpents
or stolen from the breath
of old women-

it is an old bad-tempered secret,
better left to sleep
with those cold white dogs.
