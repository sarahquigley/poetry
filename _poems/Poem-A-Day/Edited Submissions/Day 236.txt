Day 236



	Day 236 by *a-random-quigle



I walk the beach of beaches
above the water line,
I leave a line of zeros-
my prints are null, invisible
this must be sand divine.

Old Bachelors of the stars,
I&#039;ll marry all of you
if you teach me how to shift
star and nebula.

I&#039;ll make the constellations anew,
fill my pockets with the coils of galaxies,
I&#039;ll scrawl my names in the Pleiades
yet.
