Day 22

I

Toy soldiers

A clockwork bird alights
on a toothpick mast
and sings a small song,

sings a little song
as the melon boat rises and sinks in the half-light,
carrying men to far-off lands,

far-away lands
of cold mattresses
and Lego bandits.

and sings a little / tiny / thin / dancing / mellow / song / and whistles his first note / and whistles note by note

Taking a bath

A clockwork bird alights / lands / perches
on a toothpick mast
and whistles his first note

Sing a song of a soapy sea
where melon boats rise and fall
where rubber mice build shacks 
on turtles backs
and islands made/grown/shaped of/from suds and foam
are washed away by storms
where storms wash away islands
shaped from suds and foam

Sing a song of battles waged
and battles won in frothy word and deed
of frothy beards and frothy ice cream cones
and frothy cups of tea
shaped from the frothy breeze / sea 

Sing a song of frothy beards


Sing a song of wrinkled fingers 
and creased toes
of towels warm and soft

of a crisp and a quiet bed
where you drift out to sea. 

Sing a song of towels
heated in the sun


Bath and Bed

A clockwork bird alights
on a toothpick mast
and whistles his first note -

Sing a song of a soapy sea,
where melon boats rise and fall,
where rubber mice build shacks 
on turtles backs,
and storms wash away islands
shaped from suds and foam -

Sing a song of battles waged
and battles won 
in frothy word and deed,
of frothy beards and ice cream cones
and frothy cups of tea -

Sing a song of wrinkled fingers 
and creased toes,
of towels warm and soft,
and of a crisp and quiet bed
where you drift out to sea / off. 

A clockwork birds tucks
his head under his wing
and floats out to sea.

Sing a song of towels
heated in the sun





of a storm that washed an island
away in to the water

carrying 
as the soapy sea ebbs and flows / rises

his shanty is enchanted
it turns 
sings a little / tiny song
as the melon boat rises and sinks
on a soapy sea

and rubber mice and pirate 
battle
in the lamp light / twilight
carrying rubber mice and pirates
to battle 

to far away lands
of thick towels
soft mattresses
and heavy quilts

Small song

God bless the supple fingers
that sewed the first red dress,
you may not think it right lord
but I’ve something to confess:

I can think of nothing finer
than a morsel of a girl
slinking on the town
giving her hips a twirl,

her lips popping like cherries
her waist oh so divine
her nipples pouting pertly
her skin porcelain fine,

and oh lord when you touch her
she gives to you like clay,
an ever yielding sculpture
for you to mould all day
and all night
and all day
‘til-

God bless the supple fingers 
that sewed the first red dress,
God bless the supple fingers
that shaped those god-damned breasts.

Desert sky

two small suns press
through the curves
of a cornflower dress

summer dress / double entendre

two small suns press
through the curves
of a cornflower dress /sky
