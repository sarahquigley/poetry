Day 47



	Day 47 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

In the kitchen
a tv droning,
forks clinking
against plates,

shall we converse

no
eat quickly, mechanically
and let the talkshow hosts
do the talking.



Poem 2

evening haiku

pausing at a traffic light
red evening sun



Poem 3

somedays I can hear it
a sad song bobbing, marking
the moments.

somedays there’s only
breeze and birds,
car noises.

woosh



Poem 4

should a piano
brush its teeth?
