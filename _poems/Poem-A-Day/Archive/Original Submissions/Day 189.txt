Day 189



	Day 189 by *a-random-quigle



The soap in the shower is man soap

you can tell because it smells of man
and is nasty coloured olive green or mucky brown

and you are a man
and you are the soap
or the soap is you
or some such palaver
as I soap myself down
breathing deeply

but that&#039;s not the important thing
the important thing is I won&#039;t need to skin you

to wear that skin
