Day 78



	Day 78 by *a-random-quigle



The moon is foaming,
I can just about see
the house
glowing with froth.

---

Going home meant walking
across the moon.

It was cold and the ground
was hard beneath

my moon shoes,
I tottered.

Beneath the bridge
you were waiting,

oh moon monster.

---

Your fingers
bring foam.

---

Your lips 
stir me,

your fingers
bring foam,

I float
on the bright bubbles

you blow
of me.

Fabulous Frank
was a street performer
debonair -

he juggled knives,
he&nbsp;&nbsp;swallowed fire,
charmed every man&#146;s wife
he was the sun.

He married a secretary
from Phibsborough -
she worried

terribly,
he softened moon-like,
they raised three lovely kids
bought a house in Rathmines.
