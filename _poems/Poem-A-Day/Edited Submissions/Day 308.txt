Day 308

Poem 1

Otter (or that time of night)

Watching Otter from the bridge over the river,
can you imagine him floating belly-up at moonlight?

And the river slips him downstream, a velvet boat,
can you imagine sailing him between the dipping birds
their thin long legs bearing fruit,
beyond the reeds,
beyond the willows and mellowing pools?



Poem 2

sheep fleece bones
whiffs of wool
slipping across heather
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizon
scenting
the cotton bud blooms
white
