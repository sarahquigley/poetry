my childhood

dad-cutting grass- smeeling of cut grass
his trousers green with grass juice
and his runners died bright green

the house he built me
from firewood
dank and wet but I loved it

riding down the backyard in a barrow

the old sheds - dark, mysterious, musty, oil and dust
pressing bits of old ceramics we found while digging in the yard
into the concrete joints of a new stone wall

where my parents met
what they saw in each other
why their marriage broke up

climbing all of us into bed

yellow cake
taking inot school

I don't remember when we stopped crawling into bed with you
