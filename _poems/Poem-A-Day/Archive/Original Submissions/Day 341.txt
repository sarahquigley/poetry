Day 341



	Day 341 by *a-random-quigle


In the sun house
ghosts touch the walls
and fiddle with latches
hook unhook and hook again
still air.

Zombies walk the halls
grabbing at clothing sobbing gently
wrapping their fingers
around strands of your hair
like little babies. 

I am a first time mother
to a wrinkled child
who I follow, sooth and feed
as she dips in and out
of otherworld.

That lady has a girl
with her- won't somebody
help me up out of this chair
won't somebody help me-hail mary
full of grace hail mary hail mary.

The secret to trapping 
ghosts and zombies
is tea and highchairs,
clip them in and let television
do the rest.
