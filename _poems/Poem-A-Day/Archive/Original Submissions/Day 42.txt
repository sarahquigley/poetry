Day 42

Poem 1

Rocky Mountain toast

I’ll make you breakfast 
Chopped pineapple 
And orange juice,
An egg in a basket of
Bread fried golden
I’ll wake you to the sun.



Poem 2

Mister and Missus 
are out on their Sunday walk

it’s the time of year 
they walk hand in hand past
white haired dandelions and daisies
