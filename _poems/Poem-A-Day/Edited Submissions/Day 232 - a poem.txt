Day 232 - a poem



	Day 232 - a poem by *a-random-quigle



Treasure

Five neat years,
summers punctuated by markets in Galway,
noodles in Da Tang, fresh fish from the neighbours-
meanderings from beach to beach,
forgetting from one to the next
about lab techniques and Dublin... Whatever gods there were
were spilled upon the shore among the periwinkles
and the rotting jellyfish.

As the nights lengthen once again,
it&#039;s the small things that return,
the juices of your father&#039;s beef
and the sour smell of your running shorts.
Clones of your dogs prowl my house-
Blackie, ever wary, secures the perimeter
and Sile, fat as seal, waddles the halls.
That aging stock of jokes crashes from my larder unit,
smashes on the floor, shards of Bill O&#039;Herlihy-
his family were his anchor!
Afraid his house would run away, he anchored it to the earth!
His dog was anchored so that she would stay!

As the nights lengthen once again,
so many things return-
winters of curl up in bed days, of bread sauce days,
of epic Tetris Attack days... Whatever gods there were
were stacked among those blocks
or baked into plum puddings,
but we never eat plum pudding in my house.

I wonder if I would have been better off
anchored too, secured to familiar seas-
as it is I&#039;m floating free,
forever bailing sand from my shoes.
The gods are lost!

Cast off, off and away.
