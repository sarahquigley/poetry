Day 74



	Day 74 by *a-random-quigle



City 19

The city is full of beautiful people
with beautiful lives

who wake up
in the middle of the night
pack bags
and run

who wake up
in the middle of the night
down a bottle of vodka
or two
and drive

who wake up
in the middle of the night
and drive their 2007 BMWs
off some anonymous
cliff.
