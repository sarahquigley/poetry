talk to people
read their blogs
read the newspaper
learn everything you can
read a lot of books
it's the only way I know
to die and live again
stop sometimes
eat the sun
run sometimes
do what you can
love yourself
and love the ground
it's yours for now
it's harder to go backwards
than to turn around




You've only got one life they say
but you can have a few more
th only way I know
to die and live again

it'll take you more places than you can go
on your own
you don't have time

to go more places than you have time
to have more days than you have hours

Yoko in Nagasaki
Peter in San Jose
Those beautiful place names/sounds
of far far away

The outback
The great barrier reef
The rockies
