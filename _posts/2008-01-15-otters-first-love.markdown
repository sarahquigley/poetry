    Otter's
    First Love
categories: 
---

Otter's first love was not  
a rough wave,  
soft fingers, strong wrists –  
not the shrill call  
of gulls  
moving against cliffs –  
not the smooth sweep  
of stone in paw,   
the cracking of the oyster –   

floating on his back,  
he watched the boats  
come in to land –  
might he hoist a bright sail  
over his belly too  
and feel it tauten  
in the wind?
