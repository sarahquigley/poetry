
I visit the hospital with Anne marie
Now she's not my sister or my niece
she's just the girl I get to help me out around the house/ do my shopping
change my sheets
but she's a nice girl all the same
a gentle thing, like summer rain
and punctual as german trains the trains in germany
she always patient never swears
she wheels me up in a chair
helps me hobble up the stairs
I'm afraid of elevators
through corridors 
my knees are kind of sore these days
but arthritis is a bore, so I don't pay them much heed
these days

at your bed I stroke your face
I wipe your brow
and sprinkle you with water from the shrine at Knock
I think of how things used to be

I think of how we used walk
a long the Dodder river
we used to talk about the future
and how exciting it would be
the sun would hang upon the trees
the wind would rifle at the leaves,
a trapeze of light and shadow
shadow birds- cranes and ducks
making ripples by the rocks
and we'd talk about the future
how exciting it would seem


but now the future is the past
and nothing these days is built to last


I'm not able to manage that long walk
on my old knees

but now the future is the past
and nothing's ever built to last

and you looked beautiful.

how exciting it would seem
and how exciting it would be




I'm visiting St. Vincent's with Angie,
nice girl, but not much brains,
a pretty thing, a gentle rain-
she's not my daughter or my niece,
just the girl I get to help me out around the house.

The corridors are stark and white,
like the road to heaven, but with too much light
and too much disinfectant.

She wheels me up in my chair,
then I hobble up the stairs-
some things never change,
I'm still afraid of elevators.

And the rooms that I walk by
whisper with the weight
of places where people go to die-

I think of the photo on the mantelpiece,
you and I hand-in-hand
on the day before we married.
Today, though I can hold your hand, 
and stroke your face,
I don't really think you notice anymore-
the end of too many long years-

so I'll just sprinkle you with water
from the shrine at Knock,
and think of how we used walk
along the Dodder river-
the sun would hang upon the trees,
wind would rifle at the leaves,
a trapeze of light and shadow-
birds- cranes and ducks
making ripples by the rocks,
while we talked about tomorrow.
