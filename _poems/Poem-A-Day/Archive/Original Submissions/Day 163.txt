Day 163

Poem 1

Toad lived under a pebble
beside the Big Puddle.
One night, Toad decided he wanted
to see new things... 
he climbed the Wobbly Mountain,
and became a stone, stone toad cold.
He hitched a ride on a bird,
and, as the bird alighted in the Big Tree,
he wrapped his tongue around a branch.
For a whole spring and a whole summer,
he was a leaf, a veined leaf toad.
In autumn, as he drifted from his perch
and as he floated back to the Big Puddle,
a boat down the Singing Stream,
he watched the stars.

Now, every night, Toad dreams of celestial toads
kissing oily flies from the sky-
their eggs hatch into tadpoles
that pip pip pipped across the night-
wiggle wiggle wiggle pip pip pip.
(We call them planes and satellites,
or on special nights, shooting stars, 
but in his dreams,Toad knows the truth.)



Poem 2

there are only three truths
that I can tell
the pen lies (that is one)



Poem 3

If you were to love me tonight
you'd find keys stuffed down my bra,
I would toss bell-like above you
and we would peal into a restless oblivion.

As it is, the clock unlaces herself before me,
heart. The night is long and close-
I kick off my shoes, take a shower,
open to myself wet and undone.

Shrink to three small sweets:
three small bells with three small tongues,
the hand that rings them.
Moisten, suck, chew me up.

I melt carefully between
something and nothing.



Poem 4

They toss their bottles back
and clatter them down,
they smoke, they laugh,
whistle at the girls in the next compartment
who curse back.

She sits in the corner,
it is her first trip alone
you can tell by the nervous excitement
with which she watches the stations pass
and the vigilant way she guards her luggage.

Pulling her towards him,
her top slips down
revealing a sliver of breast,
he tries to tosses sweets
into her cracks - she giggles and wiggles.

Toddling between compartments,
her small frame tossed about-
she drags a bear twice her size behind her 
she tucks Bear in,
sings oblivious to the trainful of ears.

I wander the compartments,
punching tickets
sixty one and drooping fast.
