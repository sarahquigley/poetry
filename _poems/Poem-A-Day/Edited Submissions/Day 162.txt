Day 162



	Day 162 by *a-random-quigle



volcano/revolution

Soot swept from the sky,
coated like a sudden flock
of crows.
A stew stoked by love
and Kerouac,
the sun emptied herself
on the mountainside,
on the wild wild meadows,
on the wood,
on the old cobbles and familiar shopfronts.

Revolution!
I wander this young directionless land-
I can&#146;t help but miss those buried signposts,
they helped me get
from one place to another.
