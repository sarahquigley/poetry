Day 275



	Day 275 by *a-random-quigle



We woke in bed at three am
and a little chatter bird inside our heads
was wiggling like a worm,

burping stories about places we should never go,
and people we should never know-
raucous affairs, burst blood blisters-

And so our brains were stained,
but our pillows were the same as they were last night,
if a little broken in...

same window with bamboo blinds
and the same old books- the little cherry
ornament should be dusted off
and the window should be flung right open,
new birds will chatter at dawn
and eat!
