Day 7 again



	Day 7 again by *a-random-quigle


Apartment cat

The practical cat likes his food from cans-
he sits on the windowsill listening for
the clank of his metal bowl.

The practical cat sleeps all day
on cushions by the fire, all night
on feather beds at your feet.

The practical cat preens and pouts
and pounces at all the right times-
his ears are scratched, his soft fur caressed

The practical cat maintains his mane
with pride.

I’m not a practical cat-
I dream of the hunt
the taste of field mouse and robin.

I want to sleep under hedges,
to stalk through fields at night,
to scrabble up trees,
to leap
to leap
to leap-
