Day 330



	Day 330 by *a-random-quigle



in the backyard Birdie hacks
at haygrass with our old blunt scythe

she swings
she pants

the smell of morning
soil thistles grass setting seed 
would once have set her singing
funny old songs

I watch her from the kitchen
hack

the only music is the sighs
of grass
