	Day 140 Another poem by *a-random-quigle



moth eaten moon bush mottled mouse
moon mottled bush moth eaten mouse

snuffle the dictionary on the back of a mouse,
every adjective smells like a house
of bread and contentment and warmth,

she chews on the pages without any discernment,

she shortens her teeth on the spine,
you&#039;ll stumble on scraps marooned on the carpet
of armadillo pernicious turpentine wine,

bread sprinkled house frost bitten mouse
mouse bitten bread mouse sprinkled house
