Day 49



	Day 49 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

a belly full of sunlight
curled on the windowsill

fat cat watching
a summer shower



Poem 2

empty your pockets
nothing is needed
other than your skin
and a little for warmth
spring days
don’t need hats
or credit cards
everything can be done
without
at least for a few hours
