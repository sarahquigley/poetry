Day 14



	Day 14 by ~a-random-quigle



the tour bus traces the same old curves,
stopping each day to worship
at familiar spots,
the grand and the beautiful-
the National Library Trinity College
the Guinness brewery at St. James's Gate
let's run off together

find small places

forgotten parks in the backend of the Dublin
chinese foodstores
dusty bookshops-
nooks of office blocks
away from the prying eyes
of streetlights and strangers
that spot on the back of your neck
