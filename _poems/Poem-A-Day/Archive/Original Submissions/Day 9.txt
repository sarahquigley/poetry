Springtime song

Father’s out in the garden
Turning the soil for seed,
Swinging his pick and singing,
Singing a springtime song-

Mother’s up in the attic
Dusting off boxes of junk,
Swinging her broom and singing,
Singing a springtime song-

The flowers are up,
The bees sup
On the first sweets of spring-
The birds are out,
They gad about
Singing a springtime song-
I’m swinging my skirts and singing,
Singing a springtime song.
