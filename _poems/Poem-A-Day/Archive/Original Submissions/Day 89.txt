Day 89



	Day 89 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

I am a ball pool,
an excitement of
colour, smoothfirm -
you sink in me
I mould to you.



Poem 2

You pass me a drumstick
and we bond over
Tesco canapes and cheap wine.

Somehow we end up in a dark room,
someone else&#146;s bed,
a cursory fumble, a nibble or two -

I feel like a sausage roll,
like a gherkin wrapped in salami 
on a cocktail stick -

I feel like meat.
