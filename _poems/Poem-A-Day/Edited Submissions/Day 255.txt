Day 255

Poem 1

Polka dot monsters,
pinstripe tigers-
your laundry has escaped its cage-
marauds your floorboards,
roars!
A dirty smelly riot!

I want get down
on all fours
and roll with the wild things
in the carpet,
hunting lint
and dust bunnies.

Shake me from my hanger,
lead me to the closet doors-




Poem 2

Cyclops

The radiator has
an eye, a red eye-
get out the camera,
no worries of red eye here.
