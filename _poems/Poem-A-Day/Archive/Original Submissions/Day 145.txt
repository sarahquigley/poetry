Day 145



	Day 145 by *a-random-quigle



Poem 1

I used to think love only
came in twos
(God condemns those that
love themselves)



Poem 2

I wander the alleys
of your body
searching for manholes.

(I climb inside.)



Poem 3

Five a.m. someone
climbs into bunk beside you-
your bunk shakes a little
like a little hello



Poem 4

I used to just be me,
mismatched and odd-
a handknit sock, crooked,
walking to my own beat.

Now I am a scientist-
I can pipette one-handed
blindfolded upside-down.
I make tea on a bunsen burner.
My social life is bacterial,
I measure love in microlitres,
white-coated goggle-eyed
aseptic that&#039;s me.
My necklace is of mitochondria
strung on DNA.

Now I am a hippie chick-
I&#039;m nice to trees and rocks and bees,
I&#039;m careful not to sneeze on spiders.
I make jewelry from hemp and bead.
Wholefood stores are my church,
broccoli juice the blood,
the body is wholewheat,
Nutrition for vegans the bible.
Free love, baby! Free love!

Now I am an artiste-
I wear pantaloons.
I write poetry free of structure,
form, who needs it!
And, fuck it, what&#039;s the need for words.
A post-modern existential
minimalist that&#039;s me,
I pretend to like performance
art and even my farts
are atonal music.
