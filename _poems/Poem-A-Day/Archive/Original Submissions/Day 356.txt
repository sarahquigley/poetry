Day 356

Down in the blue lagoon
where anemones stroked their loverfish
dove a boy-
and down in the blue lagoon
where the octopi kissed
lived an oyster-
and it was love, boy oyster love.

Oh won't you let me inside
your fine white shell,
my beautiful one,
my pearlescent amour-
we'll set up home 
inside that cocoon,
there will be room enough for two,
for me for you my love.

But I've always wanted a kitchen
and a dining room,
a conservatory in the sun-
what about a lavatory my love-
and children?
Will there be room enough for three?
Will there be room enough for four?

My love there will be room enough,
my love there will be room enough
for me and for you,
and all the pearls
in the ocean,
and all the pearls
in the ocean.
