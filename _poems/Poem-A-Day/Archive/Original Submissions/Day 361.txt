Day 361



	Day 361 by *a-random-quigle



A sun-dried woman
strains for high fruit -
stalks break and green eggs tumble.

In some low hot market,
dust is raised by the hooves of bulls
and a swarthy hulk weighs green eggs in his hands,
brushes them against his fat lips.

He breathes deeply-
"A good mango should smell like a woman in heat,"
he says, tossing them aside.
