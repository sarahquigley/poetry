Small suns

I can never quite remember the difference
between tangerines satsumas and clementines
(if there is one)
mandarins
they are beautiful names.

My mother says they ship them in from Spain
and December is their season- an odd thing.
They have beautiful names,
these winter fruit... they dress for the season-
please remove your gloves
so I can eat you.
