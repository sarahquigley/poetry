Day 28



	Day 28 by ~a-random-quigle



fragments

lazy days
the old snail glops
towards the tree

the sea juggles rocks
lobster pots trees
small beach houses
in his calloused hands

purple splodges
on the tarmacadam
blackberry kisses
blackberry hands

a whale sifts
the sea 

a crab 

she's silver
she's slick
she's silver
she wears
whatever she reflects
she's slick
she's silver

these colours feel so
good between my fingers
my tea goes cold

your fingers are dancers

carpet play
children giggle
on the lawn

lazy days
the old snail glops
towards the tree
