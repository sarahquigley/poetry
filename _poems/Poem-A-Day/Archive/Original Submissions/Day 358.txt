Day 358



	Day 358 by ~a-random-quigle

Every morning my father shoots himself up on caffeine-
his drug, a thick black sludge
dredged from the bottom of a cafetiere.
Stern and silent,
he balances his cup on a radiator
and reads Feynman.

Over time you become a little like
your choice of beverage-
which might be why my father smashed
the teeth of the daffodils
pushing from our muddied lawn,
and I drink juice.
