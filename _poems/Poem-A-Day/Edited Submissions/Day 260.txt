Day 260



	Day 260 by *a-random-quigle



I have sailed on the riverbed,
I have sailed on the riverbed
and the mountains that I've found
beneath that moving ground
have been huge.

I have called up to the surface,
I have called up to the surface
and the waves that I've watched
from my perch on the rocks
have seemed huge.

I have bounced along the ground,
I have bounced along the ground
and I've had my share of shocks
as I balled up like my socks,
sodden girl.

I have bruised my hips and knees,
I have bruised my hips and knees,
but the mountains that I've climbed
as I watched the river wind
have been huge.
