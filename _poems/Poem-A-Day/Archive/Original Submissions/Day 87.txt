Day 87

Poem 1

Scarecrow's song

Crows
flock to that
other field,

leaving mine
undecorated,

that other field
is wheat,

it has poles
for posing.



Poem 2

What is it like to be a hurricane,
to bawl, to blow your nose
and knock over houses?



Poem 3

Don't light the caves,
don't colour or cut paths.

Leave the cool wet walls
to the blind insects
and deeper to nothing.
