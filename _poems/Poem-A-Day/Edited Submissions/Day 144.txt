Day 144

Poem 1

Those chiseled men with palmtops
that sit on trains
loosen their ties
and unbutton at me.

Unbutton 
the twilight hours of their arrival,
late again from work.

Unbutton
holidays in Vienna
and a housemaid
who&#039;ll change the sheets,
the smell of casual men
bundled off to the laundry.



Poem 2

I want to be green,
to bud and burst and go to seed,
to sprout from under my arms
and between my thighs,
for you to sow me with your drippings-
clouds of seed.

A wildflower meadow is what I want to be,
all blood kisses and nipples like the sun,
a dandelion field, a field of poppies,
I want to be green-
to bud and burst and go to seed.



Poem 3

I awake groggy,
the streetlights groggy too
blurring and blinking.
The clouds, groggy,
move like a tortoise,
treading softly,
afraid perhaps to wake the sun.
(She sleeps little enough,
summer and the latitude
being what it is.)
Too late!
Rubbing a veined eye,
(the veined sky)
oh groggy
groggy groggy groggy day...



Poem 4

In case of emergency landing,
please remove
earrings glasses and false teeth,

fasten seat belt while seated,
lifevest under your seat.



Poem 5

I know you only for your plaid underwear,
draped over the bed
dandy-

out when I go to sleep,
gone when I awake
handy.



Poem 6

Maria planted all sorts of things
apple pips, snail shells, 
the caps of empty biros.
The seeds of fanged and scaled fruit
from the exotic section
of the supermarket
were her favourites.
What do you suppose they&#039;ll be?
What do you suppose they&#039;ll be-
as if she expected them to sprout
into castles, or crystal flowers,
trees with mussel leaves
and cockle flowers.

A plant I said, just like the rest,
with leaves and things,
snail shells aren&#039;t seeds!
I&#039;ll take care of your pots
while you&#039;re away Maria,
I&#039;ll be the wet nurse.
Where is Maria? Where is Maria?
Maria is afloat on her dreams
Maria is sailing a melonboat
by the shore where the dragontrees grow,
where orchids have a tiger nose
and shake their skirts of lace.
