I was five years old
when I found her floating,
a small surprise —
bloated, upside down,
mouth agape.

Bury her in the yard
where the daffodils grow,
Mama said,
plant her like a seed —

In spring, a tree will grow —
In summer, petals fall
like sun-brushed / sun-burnished snow.
By autumn every branch
will sag
heavy
with goldfish,

we’ll gather them in bowls —
