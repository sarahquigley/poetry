Day 178

Poem 1

Jogging around the Swedish suburbs
I get lost among housing estates.
I wish I could say that I, like a Sami,
follow reindeer prints back home,
feel for the mossy side of houses.
Lidl is my northern star, I track bus routes.

I think I keep hoping that people
won&#039;t need to go to the toilet
or buy furniture in these foreign places-
or at least, if they do, bluebells will be
draped above the toilet seat.
Furniture stores will be obscure 
little shacks in the woods.
There you can watch the carpenter
sawing and sanding,
shaving out those curly bits,
carving snails and butterflies.



Poem 2

When I&#039;m at the art gallery,
I take some time out to study
those really dull paintings-
countless portraits of the Earl
of Somewhere and the Countess
of Somewhere Else (probably in France).
Their white faces become moons
that I hold in orbit...
until all of a sudden the Earl
mows the lawn next door
and slugs a beer.
I meet the Countess on the train
to Vasteras,
lugging a suitcase the size of a horse
and tutting at the conductor.
