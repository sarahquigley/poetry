Poem 1

Everyday she worked for him
And every night she slept with him
And when he died she wept for him
And flew off to Barbados.


Poem 2

Wanderer’s Song

I don’t much smoke
And I don’t much drink
And I don’t much sow
The wild oats,
Oh I pray all day
And I sleep all night
In a home shacked 

From
Seamus Brennan
Election posters.
