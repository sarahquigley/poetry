Day 253



	Day 253 by *a-random-quigle



The murmur of cars
tosses me away,
half-dead,
half-eaten,

the snaking road finishes me off-
rainlight on the roads,
streetlights - 
cage of bone.

What a surprise Frank!
Fancy meeting you here
Frank! It got you,
the rhythm swallowed you down too.

We wait for diamonds and grapefruit,
old Frank and I
sitting on that curb
of oesophagus.
