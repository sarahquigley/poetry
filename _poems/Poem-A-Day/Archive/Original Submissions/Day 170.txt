Day 170



	Day 170 by *a-random-quigle



Let me tell you a secret, I am a thief.
As the city grows dark
I steal the monsters that ooze
from under your bed
or pounce from the back of the closet.
It is not their fanged shadows 
that slip by the window
in the gloom of the night.
And you can pretend
that there&#039;s not a little thrill
in meeting monsters every night,
but I know the truth-
I am a thief.
