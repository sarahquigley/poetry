Day 196



	Day 196 by *a-random-quigle



I found a shed under the elders-
it&#039;s rotting to splinters
and reeks to high heaven,
years of gathering damp.

I want to stay beautiful,
I want to stay pristine,
oh but the day passes so quick,
leave me wilting.

Handy shed though-
private, away from prying eyes,
and if worst comes to worst
I can set a match to it,

a place to keep
my chin hairs and my wrinkles
and every new mole
and mottled patch?

to be beautiful?
Moles are cheaper than tattoos.
