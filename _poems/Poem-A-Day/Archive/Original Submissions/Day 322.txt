Day 322



	Day 322 by *a-random-quigle



Why do we walk on spider legs
can he play the mandolin
is there flavour to the gods

I've plucked carrots from this soup
yet I can't understand the dog
why she loves the way she does

what she dreams at night
what she thinks of rust and rain
and the journey home again
