Day 51

Poem 1

A chapped-lipped old door
wheezes and opens, hoping
the scents of barbecues, of wine
and children still linger
in the air.

Long gone, only a floosy breeze
rocking on the porch swing
rustling down the hall
swinging round the rocking chair 
and up the chimney tall,

off on a romp,
to bounce around the power station,
hide behind the smoke stacks
smack the smoke around,
long gone, even a floosy breeze.

Good riddance,
the mice and the beetles, the wood rot
are more constant friends.



Poem 2

wolf

run
until you become
a tapestry of snow
