Day 16



	Day 16 by ~a-random-quigle



hello clouds hello sky!

yellow balloon rising,
leaving the ground behind
without a wave goodbye-

yellow balloon travelling,
seeing the sights abroad,
the Eiffel Tower of Paris,
the Sultan of Brunai-

yellow balloon soaring
higher higher higher high,
yellow balloon,
moon balloon,
two moons in the sky-

yellow balloon floating,
yellow boat on the wind,
gently rocking, suddenly sinking-
oh no it's sprung a leak!

yellow balloon bobbing,
dipping its stringy toe,
yellow balloon dripping,

hello sea hello fish!
