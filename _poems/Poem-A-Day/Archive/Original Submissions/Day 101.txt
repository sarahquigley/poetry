Day 101

Poem 1

Traffic light
(traffic light)
and traffic light,
all green thank god
if I have to hear another
moan from the back

you&#146;d think she was birthing,
late for the
hairdresser&#146;s.

It&#146;s tremendous,
Ma
slept three whole days
and nights,
on the fourth
she was still drunk -
she broke her glasses
burnt herself on the toaster
cursed
went back to bed.

Your words were small
and so I cupped them,
ladybird cockroach spider.
At home, safe and jarred,
the three walked the glass
questing for escape.

I fed them well, let them
crawl about my arms
raising hairs,
I caressed them,
told them good stories,
they were my children.



Poem 2

The laptop is smooth skinned
and dressed in silver,
she has ports where you plug stuff in
and keys where you input your junk
and a trackpad where you pleasure her at night.



Poem 3

A bus
stuffed with summer,

breathing the heat
of breath
of bodies,

the ladybird faints
into my lap
her dress is silk,

I don&#146;t give her CPR,
but I want to.



Poem 4

At night I dream of coloured fish,
their thick lips greet me
as I slip gently between worlds,
&#147;boy,&#148; their smooth voices whisper,

in the morning I say twenty Hail Marys
just in case.
