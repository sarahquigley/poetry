Day 33



	Day 33 by ~a-random-quigle



all I want to hear
is a dozen bird songs

and all I want to do is
sink into the grass
and drink the air
and you

watch the sun play
on your wispy hair
as you crawl
and sing along
your own kind of barbled
bird song

hold you to my breast
and sleep

sleep as insects
crawl over my face
and you
drink
